       "'  I departed PSP on time and arrived to DFW. I had a 5 hour layover and saw 20 or 30 random people sprinting back and forth. American Airline Customers missing flights. I just knew it was going to happen to us. My flight boarded almost an hour late, and then the pilot didn’t show up. I land in Charlotte and sprint to my terminal but show up 3 minutes after 10 pm. The app said E31 and my electronic boarding pass said E17? Of course the one time American Airlines can meet a time line is after it forced us to miss our flight. So now I’m stuck in the airport with a hungry 8 year old, she had lunch but no dinner because everything is closed. Luckily they gave us a $12 meal voucher, that’s about enough for a bottle of water and a granola bar maybe. But again everything is closed.   It took 40 minutes just to check a bag. Extremely inefficient. Due to this, our plane left 25 minutes late to wait to get late checked bags. If you want to wait for late bags get a better system and make your layovers longer. Last time I will fly with AA because it never goes smoothly.  Columbus to Dallas Fort-Worth with American Airlines. This has been a disaster from the get go!! We were delayed on every flight trying to get to my sons graduation from military boot camp. Problems with plane maintance with taking off, with customer service asking oh do you have bags? To being stranded at the airport over night, and missing my sons graduation procedures. Horrible airline and experience! \\xa0 \\xa0I’ve flown all my life and this is by far the best airline to fly. There was not one bump on this flight. Smoothest flight ever. Then my flight from LAX on was the same. Not one bump. These are the most experienced pilots to fly with.   Took the available seats next to the restrooms in the back, and was unfortunate to find that I was not provided any overhead storage in this abnormally small row, and had to hold by of my carry on bags under my legs or as they call \"stow \" under the seat in front of me. Come to find out the closest available overhead was already occupied by flight attendants. Attendants are rude and unapproachable. They did not assist me with my stowage issue, and basically served not purpose on this flight.   I would strongly recommend flying a different airline. I\\'ve never experienced so many issues and I\\'ve flown many times but never with this airline. We were sent a text at 1:30am alerting us our flight at 6:08am was delayed until 8:45am instead. No problem right? Well, we\\'d be missing our connecting flight from Charlotte to Milwaukee because of this delay. So we had to change our whole flight. Ended up separating the group i was in. My friend was put on a 9:30am flight with a connection in Charlotte and a flight back to Milwaukee around 4pm. Making her back home at 7pm. While my other friend & I were put on a separate flight leaving Miami at 2:22pm & arriving in Raleigh at 4:44pm with a connecting flight in Charlotte at 8:35pm leaving to Milwaukee at 10:52pm. While waiting in Raleigh, the gates kept getting switched and so did the times. The plane was not there at 8pm. Not at 9pm & not even at 10pm. We didn\\'t leave Raleigh until almost 11pm. While waiting in Raleigh, our friend texted & told us her flight from Charlotte to Milwaukee was also getting switched multiple times & she was STILL at the airport waiting for it at 10pm. With the flight being delayed multiple times, we ended up missing our connecting flight in Charlotte to Milwaukee. Their next available flight to Milwaukee wasn\\'t until 7:45am the next morning. So we had to stay the night in Charlotte. Their customer service was terrible as well. So many rude employees working at the airport in Charlotte. Just an overall terrible experience & I will never fly American Airlines again. There is no option to give zero stars but i wouldn\\'t even give it the 1.   When we brought the ticket from Miami to Syracuse it was just 6hrs. Now it’s been 36 hrs that we are still waiting and stuck in Charlotte. We have been told that we will be provided with the hotel voucher in Charlotte. When we arrived to Charlotte 11pm there was nobody in the customer service until 4 am in the morning, and then we were acting like we are the ones that responsible for this shit. I would never travel with American Airlines again, and I don’t think that there is any other good airlines in USA. This is ridiculous that domestic fights taking longer than international ones. My whole trip was ruined.   Worst customer Service ever! I will never fly with this airline again. I rarely fly first class but really needed some me time so I decided to treat myself. From the moment I sat down not one word from the stewardess. I was not asked if I was ok, did I need anything ... nothing! She literally took some reading material from her personal bag and was gone the whole flight! The stewardess from the back came up to get something and I stopped her and asked if I could have a cup of ice, which she gave me. Then again no one around. Then they collected garbage from the back and walked right past me to the front and never took my cup... seriously! I felt like I was being punished for being in first class! I am not a demanding person and very friendly so I don’t know why this happened other than she felt no need to do her job. The plane was not full and I was the only one in first class besides a pilot that was catching a ride who got his own water when he boarded and a woman with a child that I think moved up from the back when they said you can move to a different seat. I was totally disappointed and that stewardess should look for a different job! She made the airline that she represents look very bad as well as herself. Shame on her. I don’t normally right reviews but felt like this warranted mentioning.   Roundtrip to PVD connecting in CLT during each leg. Outbound legs were on Airbus A321 whereas the Inbound legs were on Boeing 737-800. On both outbound and inbound, I sat in Main Cabin Extra which provided much welcomed additional legroom. WiFi entertainment worked flawlessly on personal device (I used iPad) to watch movies. AA planes no longer have in seat TV screens; however, each seat has a personal device seat back holder that one can affix a personal device. Aircraft was very clean and cabin crew very friendly. Food service consisted of pretzels and soft drinks. Very much appreciated the pilot informing us that because of bad weather in the mid Atlantic states he would take a detour to get to PVD from CLT. This added about 40 minutes extra to flying time but it was better than being stranded. All flights with the exception of CLT-PVD leg were on time. Only negative is why if someone is paying additional monies for Main Cabin Extra one has to board in Group 5. I was fortunate that on all 4 flights I was able to stow my carryon bag in the overhead cabin. Absolutely the worst, ridiculous and incompetent people to deal with. My first flight was delayed and i missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. When i asked the stewardess what i should do, she doesn\\'t know either and told me to just walk fast. First of all, you don\\'t know? How can you work there and not know what to do? Can you not coordinate the schedule? Why even make those connecting flights when it is obvious that they never make it on time? I was then rerouted by a customer service to another gate which literally closed! Also never made it to my destination that day! Never again American Airlines.   This airline has no regard for their customers. Every flight is hours delayed and yet you always seem to miss your connecting flight. They take no accountability for their mess ups. I spent my entry day the airport 7.30am to 12am the following day. For all this you would believe I flew overseas. I’ve flown all over the world with many airlines even Spirit and after flying with American I’d rather book Spirit daily.   Worst service ever in Buenos Aires. My valid credit card has not been accepted and they sent me to pay to Buenos Aires Airport just to find that the office was closed and the open office was next to my house in Buenos Aires. And they barely apologized.   After they let most people with carry-on bags on board they stopped me and a few other passengers with large bags and took my small carry-on bag away claiming I cannot put under my seat. Horrible experience. Plus my original flight was delayed so I had to take a red eye and was late for my meeting. I will never book with American Airlines. I flew with other airlines and have never had this horrible experience. The counter person did not know anything and kept saying they cannot get me into different Airline but another person corrected him. The counter person seemed fake and not trying or caring.   Never again will I fly AA! I don’t care if Delta is charging $200 more per ticket. Flight was delayed secondary to \\'weather\\' and we missed our connection which meant we stayed the night in Chicago and have been waiting nearly 18 hours to \\'maybe\\' get on a plane to CWA. They could have easily transferred the ticket to delta whom could of got us home already but they won’t because of \\'weather\\'. The Delta rep told us that they don’t want to give up the money even though airlines are constantly doing this, it’s one persons decision not to. In any event AA has managed to anger thousands of people with this little stunt! Never again AA, never again! You could give me free travel vouchers world wide and all I would do is wipe my backside with them because I’ll never fly your airline again!   A 3+ hour Delay caused me to miss not one but two connecting flights. They first announced a one hour delay which would’ve caused me to miss my first connecting flight. I immediately called American to change to a later connecting flight. I figured 2 hours later should be plenty. For the next hour they increased the delay by 20-40 minute increments until it was a 3 1/2 hour delay, causing me to now be missing my second connecting flight, the last one of the day. I am now on hold with American which the automated message says has a  4 hour hold time. At this point I’m going to have to try to reschedule my flight, which was booked a month ago, to tomorrow, provided that’s even a possibility. I will never fly American again.   Flight AA674 on November 7th 2023 was a nightmare. We were stuck in the plane for 2 hours in scorching hot and sunny 91 F weather. While waiting in the airplane, airline crew never served us any cold drinks. For the 2 hour waiting period, we got only several updates from pilot staff. First update was , \"We are waiting for tech to show up and complete safety log\". Next update was 1 hour later , \"The tech arrived and did the checks but he can\\'t log in into online log system.\" Another half an hour later, the pilot said, \"We decided to do paper log because we couldn\\'t figureout online log system\". It took them 1.5 hour to realize paper form exists! Every company has downtime forms. Does American airline company know that there is such a thing as downtime forms.  Why does it take a big company like Americans Airlines 1.5 hour to figure it logging? Next update from pilot we got 2 hours after scheduled take off time, \"Sorry for delay. We had technical issues with oxygen tanks, so that\\'s why you had to wait all this time. We are replacing 5 oxygen tanks on our airplane.\" So why couldn\\'t the pilot be honest in the beginning? As a customer, I deserve to have a truthful update from airline staff. This incident definitely broke my trust in American Airlines. Being stuck in hot and full airplane for 2 hours with no attempts of the staff to do anything about it to alleviate the discomfort was utterly humiliating. Not to mention that we missed our connecting flight because of very long and painful flight delay.    This has been one of the worst experiences I\\'ve had. First, the flight from Philadelphia to Miami was delayed, and now the one from Miami to the Dominican Republic is also delayed by more than 3 hours. And I haven\\'t slept for 12 hours.   This was hands down the worst airline I have flown. The plane got delayed got stuck in Dallas, they refused to help or refund ticket, 10 plus hours waiting over night. They would not provide room, no drink on plane. I will never fly with them again.  Airplane was in disrepair, 2-3 delays, borrowed manoeuvring engine (3) 2 or 3 gate changes, verbalized shortness of staff several times, cabin door seal was leaking creating a loud sound. Captain and stewards were great though. Terrible airline, first time flying with them and last.   Was returning from vacation and they cancelled my flight. The people I spoke to on the phone and in person were rude and basically just took the attitude \"sucks to be you.\" They booked me on another flight more than 2 days later. I missed an incredibly important doctor appointment. I missed work. My car spent 2 extra days in long term parking. I was compensated for nothing. No meals. No hotel stay. They said they don\\'t compensate for flights cancelled for weather. It was sunny out. There is no way the flight was cancelled for weather conditions, they just said that so they did not have to compensate anyone. I attached pictures of the \"terrible weather.\" Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced   The airline and staff did not care that we lost our connecting flight due to their crew being late. They had no solution for us and we had to spend the night at the airport. They did not provide us with any food (everything was closed at the airport) no hotel, no transportation. They were rude and could care less if how this affected people. Terrible customer service.   On Thursday, October 12, 2023, I had a flight with a connection from Tampa through Charlotte to Indy.\\xa0 The plane was late to Tampa and sat on tarmac for a while before finally taking off and then I still missed my connection to Indy from Charlotte because I was not able to run to make the connection.\\xa0Then we were told to wait at customer service.\\xa0 I made the gate before departure time by the way.\\xa0 At customer service there was one agent who then decided to leave for her lunch, and we were told that another agent would be there in 5 minutes!\\xa0 Leaving no one at the counter. There were at least 20 people in line from all over the country who had missed their connections.\\xa0 Shortly thereafter there were 4 agents. My question is:\\xa0 How many corporate people have had to stay overnight in an airport that is under construction, by yourself so you are not really comfortable falling asleep with no one else to help watch your things, or just falling asleep as a female on her own, where all the stores and restaurants are closed.\\xa0 Mind you, the flight had already been changed from getting into Indy at 9:30 at night to 12:13 am. I am a teacher and was trying to get a couple days to relax before going back to school.\\xa0 This was everything but relaxing and very frustrating and unfortunately American Airlines has lost 3 customers because of this treatment and disregard for what people are going through.\\xa0 I didn’t have anywhere to be necessarily but I heard others were trying to get to a funeral, a wedding, a surgery.\\xa0 You never know what is going on in someone’s life.\\xa0 I was told we were not able to get hotels or food vouchers because of way the flight was coded as “air traffic” which is still not my fault.\\xa0 I just don’t understand what is going on with the airlines and their level of customer care and dependability!\\xa0 Yes, I was put on another flight but what about my time I had to spend in the airport with no food or comfortable, safe place to rest?  Booked a flight with them for July 28th and I thought because of social distancing they would attempt to keep passengers somewhat seated apart .. nope, everyone was packed together on the plane, completely overcrowded. It was an so uncomfortable to put it into perspective, took a flight back using JetBlue, night and day difference, no overcrowding, they even offered snacks and water bottles in individualized zip lock bags (not offered this at all with American Airlines). To add injury to insult, American Airlines charged us twice as much for the tickets as JetBlue did.   They have earned bankruptcy, “delayed 12 hours for fog.” Or maybe they don’t have enough crews, ran out of duty day for a weather delay, and they again demonstrate their sustain for their customers. I really hope our government doesn’t bail these business wizards out! Paying twice to have terrible service, is a bad idea.   Returning from a trip to Belize, flying American Airlines  which had only one connecting flight at the Dallas / Ft. Worth airport, we arrived (first class) in Chicago, very late at night. Upon checking in to a hotel, before driving home the next day, I opened my suitcase to find that it had been rifled through! Zippers had been left open and items were all over the suitcase and mixed in with my clothes! Even my dopp kit was open and many of the bathroom items were scattered among my things! As late as it was and as frustrating as this poor handling of my things was, I decided to let it go, until the next morning. As we approached our car, I remembered that I had to get the fob for the vehicle out of my suitcase. It was nowhere to be found. It is my unswerving habit, when traveling, to transfer the fob to the suitcase, upon arrival at wherever will be “home base” during any vacation. That fob was in the suitcase during the entire vacation. Keep in mind that any baggage issues need to be reported to AA within ridiculously short periods of time to have any hope of processing a claim! Luckily, I acted pretty quickly and sent a message describing what had happened. Unluckily, I was now entering the Twilight Zone of such claims processes with AA! They sent a reply with a link to their claims process. Immediately, it was evident that this could not be done automatically. AA’s auto system will absolutely not let you submit any claim that does not have a specific receipt for the item lost. No flexibility. No options offered. So, now I’m through the looking glass of trying to handle this by phone. The first person listened to the whole thing and told me he was not the right person, but would transfer me. I, having dealt with many such customer service systems said (very nicely) that I’d rather not explain that same story seven times. Was the next dept. going to be the correct one? “Oh, yes sir.” Of course, it was not. After explaining it 2 more times, I got the proper dept. Now, came the requests for receipts again! This is a fob! It has no specific receipt. I calmly said that I thought a call to Belize City and Dallas airports to check their found items might do the trick. I was placed on hold and, when she got back on the phone, I was told that Belize City did not have it and Dallas Ft. Worth was their headquarters and was so busy that it would be hard to get a hold of anyone! That needs repeating, Dallas Ft. Worth was their headquarters and was so busy that it would be hard to get a hold of anyone! After way too much chat, it was decided I could send proof of the car purchase, of all the insane things. Also, they wanted an estimate of replacement value. So, I went to our initial dealership and got the parts dept. to send me an estimate, which I forwarded to AA, with proof of flights and ID. The estimate clearly pointed out that the fob transmitter is $101.30, the physical key kept inside the fob is $62.66, and the programming of the fob to our vehicle (absolutely necessary, as is known by anyone who has operated a vehicle with such a device!) $165. With tax, the total was going to be $347.05. They took all this info. and replied that they would be sending a check for $80.75! And, it was going to be 30 days!   The male flight attendant from Miami as he stated is the best, such a funny and sweet person upon arrival stepping onto the flight was very welcoming energy, as all of us have been dealing with the delay of the flight. This was flight 5553 flying to Washington DCA. He is very engaging with the passengers, understanding and funny 10/10 if we could copy and paste him I would for flights.   Refuse to fly American Airlines again. I understand many companies are hurting due to the pandemic and especially airlines, but the safety and satisfaction of customers should come first and foremost. I was absolutely disgusted by the disorganization of seating and how packed these planes were. I also felt extremely cramped and the staff wasn’t exactly friendly. I will pay extra if I have to do that I can avoid using this airline again.   Picture this: your flight is delayed for a reroute flight plan but eventually takes off 30 mins later only to land 3 hours later at an unscheduled airport causing you and your wheelchair assist family to miss an international connecting flight and now you are stranded. You cannot rebook your flight using the app as it still says “delayed” 3 hours later. You are directed to call an speak to an agent which is a 3.5 hour long wait while your connecting flight has already landed! You are not offered even a beverage. You cannot receive your luggage in order drive to the next airport. And your family cannot receive any updates from the staff who are now mutes. But you have paid upfront all of the required fees and taxes for every single facet of these flights. And somehow the courtesy of communication was not included in that cost. Take your business elsewhere. It would be easier to just walk.   Me, my wife and kids were ready to go to Cancun. We are driving to the airport and we received an email cancelling our fly. We desired to go to the airport and found a fly from a different airline. We spent a week in Cancun. The night before our departure we got the same email that the fly coming home was cancelled. My advise to anyone that is planning vacations or they have the need to use an airplane, do not use American Airlines.  Now I’m stuck in Cancun Mexico and don’t know when I’m gonna get home thanks to American Airlines.  We had a bit of a mix up with our flights getting unknowingly shuffled, which split up our group of travelers. We were under a lot of stress the last couple of days trying to get it changed and were unsuccessful. We decided to take a chance and go to the airport to try and fix it. The moment we got there, the man working for the airline at the front desk was the most helpful and kind person he could have been. We told him our situation and where other staff members refused to help on the phone, he immediately did everything he could. He managed to get us all on the same flight and all the way home. He was the most calm and kind man. I wish I had known his name, but he worked at the Honolulu airport at the front main desk. He really saved our trip.   1st July 2024 \"celebrated\" my birthday with my 1st (and probably last) trip with American Airlines. Travelled with my autistic daughter to visit family in the US. Anyone who has a neurodivergent child knows how important routine and special possessions are to them. Her birthday was the day before we travelled, her presents were in her suitcase, as were the \"specials\" she\\'d saved up for and bought for the trip. I even booked special assistance for her. Flight London Heathrow to Charlotte Douglas via Dublin. My bag arrived unscathed. My daughter\\'s (along with those of at least 5 other travellers) didn\\'t. And despite all our endeavours, 5 days later it still hasn\\'t. \"We\\'re still trying to locate your bag\". Although on landing at CLT, we were told that it hadn\\'t been loaded at LHR but should arrive within the next day. Hah! We\\'ve spent hours on the phone to AA, every day getting a different response. Including fobbing us off with non-existent phone numbers. Shame on you, American Airlines.  Absolute worst airline experience, I never thought it could be so bad. They delayed several times and cancelled my connecting flight. Set me up with a hotel, I wasn’t able to have my checked baggage, but the agent at customer service assured me that I needed to get a ticket in the AM for the next flight to Denver. I’m the morning I received 3 texts delaying my flight to Denver. When I showed up for the scheduled flight the lady at customer service said that the flight I was supposed to take already took off in the morning, when I showed her the texts I received she said she didn’t know why I got those. She was able to get me a flight later that day, which was delayed once again. Then at the gate they said that the flight was full so I had to check in my carry on bag, I was already down another from the previous flight.   A whole day of flight delays. Delayed 90 mins from ARA to DFW. Missed my connecting flight, but rebooked me for another flight that was 4 hrs away from my original departure time from DFW. Received numerous text messages about my departing flight gate change - the gate changed 4 times. Finally caught my rebooked, delayed flight 7 hrs later just to sit on the plane for another 40 mins to an hour before departing. Seriously, who can make this up? I honestly thought there were only two poverty airlines, but AA is right there with them. I wouldn’t recommend this airline unless you had to choose between the other two terrible airlines that somehow still exists. And even then, don’t make plans because you’ll be traveling for over 10 to 15 hours for an hour and a half flight.   This May was my first time flying American Airlines and out of all my traveling (I fly at least once every two months or more) this airline was horrible. Absolutely atrocious customer service, many were not even wearing masks. They are overcrowding their planes, and are not polite to their customers. I had an early flight and go there and my bag had a few extra pounds, and they asked me to take out the extra pounds, which is understandable. But seeing as this is an uncertain time, I was moving out of my dorm room with everything I owned from boarding school. I also had to say goodbye to some people that are very close to me and was very upset, and there was no empathy, understanding, or kind words and support to help me get my bag emptied out. I ended up carrying multiple bags, and they made me check a bag at the gate anyways, which was upsetting because it probably weighed more than my original bag. To top it off, they did not believe that I had paid for my checked bag even though I was physically presenting them with the receipt. On top of this experience I had, which left me very upset, my boyfriend was coming to visit me and had an absolutely horrible experience. They scheduled an arrival to Dallas with a flight of 160, and 110 of those people had less than 20 minutes to get to their connecting flights. He arrived at his gate, with the jetway still attached, and they did not let him board the flight because he was a few minutes late. In return, they did not let him on it when he asked, and made him BUY another flight for the next day to a different destination. No vouchers or anything. He had to buy meals, a hotel room, and transportation to and from the hotel. The customer service was very lacking and the airlines had been rude and disappointing to many other customers. He was with several other travelers that had suffered the same fate as him. They were several hundred dollars down, and were majorly thrown off with their travel plans. This airline is a horrible company and is NOT worth the cheaper flights. They have little respect or sympathy for others and their plans which can be very important. You can never assume someone will be okay missing their flight and rescheduling, as an airline they should do everything in their power to give their customers what they paid for, and an easier experience flying. I am not a spoiled or picky person and am fine with lower quality planes and food, but when me and those close to me are being disrespected by a company we paid, it does not feel good.   I frequently fly this route and flight is delayed most of the time. Today it has been delayed three times and now they are saying that crew staff is also late and we have wait till they arrive even though aircraft may be here. Never has such poor service with other airlines. I have decided to not use AA unless I absolutely have to. Very disappointing!   On 11/11/21 American cancelled my flight from TPA to CHT. There was no weather condition and I was never given a reason why the flight was cancelled. They booked me on a later flight from TPA to DCA. That flight was delayed by 45 minutes. When boarding, we were stopped and told to wait in the jet way. They left us standing in the jet way for 15 minutes until finally they told us they had to clean the plane. So that flight was actually an hour late departing. Because of the late departure, I missed my connecting flight home to MHT. Since it was night time, I was told I could get a flight in the morning. There were no more flights that night. After sleeping in the terminal for about 15 minutes, the American gate agent I was speaking with about my missed flight informed me there was another flight at 11:30pm. I went to the gate to see that flight was no delayed 45 minutes. 10 minutes later that changed to departing in 30 minutes. The flight to MHT was on board one of the regional jets. Small, cramped, uncomfortable cattle car. Flight attendant obviously stressing out because she doesn\\'t like her job (she said that to us) wanted me to move to another seat so she would have less passengers to take care of. Because she couldn\\'t do anything about that, I was subjected to dirty looks and mumbling under her breath at me. She is one of many reasons why flying is a horror story these days. Even at TPA, the ticket agent who told me my flight was cancelled for reasons I still don\\'t know had a horrible attitude and her behavior was disgusting. I did report both employees to American Airlines.  I got the usual apologies from American which are worthless and they wanted me to buy more tickets and give me a small $100.00 discount. These people are the worst of the worst. I declined giving these losers another penny of my money.   I just had my worst experience ever flying courtesy of American Airlines. I booked a round-trip and I lost a day stranded in the airport to go to my destination because American Airlines delayed my flight and now I\\'m stranded in Miami until Wednesday because American Airlines just canceled my Monday flight at the last minute and they just left me to my luck.   I was checked in the day prior to the flight and was bumped from an additional flight as a stand by passenger, in addition to not making this flight, and was offered to wait to hours on standby again. As I have photos of my arrival to the the desk with official documentation that it was prior to the 15 minutes of the gates closing. My name was not called over the intercom as other airlines did in the airport. Savannah is a small airport with 15 gates. I will never fly American Airlines again. Delta Airlines is a Georgia based company and I was bumped last week during the global technology issue and without even an email, complaint, or phone call, they offered financial compensation to me, without even asking. Delta Airlines has great customer service and is a model of exceptional customer service. I am not flying American Airlines, their customer service at every level from the local employees to the customer service department. I know it will not make a difference in the big picture. I will also make reviews, provide my personal insight, and continue to report my concerns to friends and family. Deeply disappointed.  Worst flight ever. Save your money and fly with another aircraft. How would you like to fly with you 3 kids of one is a baby and you get into Miami at 5, your next flight departing at 7pm but they delay your flight and you don’t fly out until 12:00am and when you call to get some compensation the give you 7,500 points which is equivalent to $75.00 for a 1,059 flight. No meal ticket and no option to rebook because the next flight only have 2 seats available. So you are stuck sitting at the airport with a crying baby and 2 tired kids. Never again!   This airline is absolutely the worst. They don’t have direct flights from Denver to San Diego, so both ways i had to stop in Phoenix. I had to walk a mile and a half in 10 minutes to make my second flight and when I landed I was the absolute farthest gate from the exit. Not only that but when I flew from SD to Phoenix on the way to Denver, my flight was delayed three hours.   I missed a connection from MIA to SFO due to two hold ups. The first was due to a long line at immigrations, the second was at the American Airlines bag drop off. The line was long, so American Airlines employees began calling out other passengers to cut the line so they would not miss their flight. I, in turn, missed my flight as no less than 15 passengers passed me while I was “next” in line. My experience gets worse. I originally booked a business class flight, but they had to re-book me in coach. I also had to stay a night in a hotel. Did AA reimburse me for the $119 hotel? NO. Did they give me back the $600 I spent to be in business class despite not being in business class? NO. Did the first rep tell me these costs would be reimbursed? Yes. This is how they treat their customers.  Horrible experience. They cancelled my flight on Christmas with less than 10 hours notice. They put me on hold for 30 minutes and said they would only offer me a flight that was 9 hours longer than the one I originally booked with two new connections I would have to catch. Very rude in their delivery as well. I ended up having to get a flight a day later and they said they would give me no compensation for the change in flight - even though I have to pay for a hotel reservation I can not move and I am missing Christmas with my family. Save yourself and fly a different airline because this was a horrific experience. Wish I could give less than zero stars.   Worst customer care ever. Lost our luggage then had to wait the next day for 2 hours just to get someone to get it. Called to let them know we were here for the bag and they said they only have one person working they would get to it when they could. One person responsible for everyone’s luggage just does not sit well with me. Wrst experience ever.   I will never fly with this airline again, it was a nightmare. They can’t have honesty with the customer, they put my family in stand by situation without let me know. When I was in Miami, customer representative told me I have to wait next day and they will not pay a hotel room, I have to sleep in the gate with my kids. They put me in Another stand by list the next day this people can careless rude customer service not worthy and don’t even expect any tickets refund.  We stood in line in St. Lucia for over 2.5 hours because they only had 2 windows open to check in people for 3 international flights. This was similar to our other 2 legs only worse leaving St. Lucia. When we got to the window the attendant didn\\'t process us as expected and did not/would not tell us what was wrong. When we pushed, he finally admitted he couldn\\'t find evidence that we had flown to the island on American a week earlier. We definitely had. Our tickets and flight information on our phones, nor our stamps on our passports convinced them of this. We could hear overhead announcements calling us to board our plane so we offered to buy new tickets and work this out late, but the attendant stood with the phone to his ear like some inanimate object with no ability of problem solve. After an hour with him, we insisted on speaking to his supervisor. A lady with better communication skills came out and only took one more hour to get us a room and taxi to overnight at Coconut Bay. With no resolution as to what went wrong and now with expired covid tests they put us on a flight the next day, so that we arrived home in the midst of a blizzard.   We found out the day of that they rescheduled our flight to 4:00 pm from 1:00 pm. If I knew this was the time I would’ve cancelled the flight and scheduled with someone else. The original flight time is still in service, but the lady said I couldn’t get on the flight because there were no seats available. So we checked our bags and went to the gate and asked the lady there and she said since we checked our bags we cant get on the flight even though seats were available. They did not comp us for anything and I completely fail to understand why we were bumped when they still have the 1:00 flight.  Horrific. The gate agents decided to close the gate 20 minutes early for their convenience. I explained my neck is broken, which can clearly be seen, and my immediate family member just died. I also explained my Father is very sick and this would be his last birthday. I had documents to show this was true. They said they didn’t care, and would book a flight 12 hours later, that would cause me to miss seeing my family. I also cannot sit in airports for hours through multiple changes because I am in excruciating pain. They said they didn’t care, and I showed proof I am going into surgery in 5 days. They didn’t care. Said they might give me a refund, but didn’t know if they would. Thank you American for once again letting me down when I needed you to respond like rational human beings. I may never see my Dad again, except at his funeral. I’ll make sure to send you his obituary, and will make sure not to count on you to get me there.   Very disappointed in drinks given out. Warm, half of glass of water. We paid good money and AA can\\'t afford ice. Never again book this company. Very warm in plane and could not hear messages on intercom. Really need to update speakers.   Hands down the worst customer service I\\'ve ever encountered. I had bought very expensive plane tickets last year and because of COVID I had to postpone my trip. AA had absolutely no way of working with me on getting my money back. It\\'s obvious they just wanted to make money off of anyone who had planned trips in 2020. AA split my trip into two travel vouchers, which ironically you can\\'t use on the same trip. And the vouchers I received were only good until July 2021. Cut to now I\\'m on the phone with customer service trying to find said vouchers in their system (they can\\'t look you up by phone number or any other details besides a flight number. You\\'re out of luck if you don\\'t have that info.) and the customer service rep was so rude, so impatient that he said he needed to make a call about the vouchers and would call me back. Then I got hung up on. I\\'m out $500+. Unbelievable.   Philadelphia to Boston. Worst customer service ever. Flight attendant was unprofessional, weird, rude and nervous. Usually I don’t write reviews but this time I have to. Poor service. I would not recommend it.   AA is really turning to the dark side. We would always book the cheapest AA tickets and could always talk with agents and get them changed if we needed to (assuming it was over 2 weeks out, etc), but no more. This apparently changed recently without warning. We\\'ve been trying to bump back a flight to a later date and every rep we\\'ve talked to has been not only unhelpful, but rude about it to boot. Seems like AA is becoming another victim of the race to the bottom for terrible customer service.   American Airlines is not family friendly. I was traveling with 3 children ages 5, 3 and 8 weeks. I asked to pre board as stated on the website for additional time to get all my children settled. The employee at the gate would not allow us to board until group 5 which held up everyone boarding behind us. I will not travel with American Airlines again   The worst customer service and flight experience since I started flying 50 years ago. Delayed flights, mechanical issues, diverted flights with zero attempts to re-book or have our connection wait 20 minutes for us. They could not care less whether we ever made our final leg to St. Thomas USVI. Fly any other airline.   Flight was canceled at last minute and they rebooked me on their next available route which was a non direct flight through Washington DC requiring two overnight stays. I ended up renting a car and drove to Atlanta with 4 other family members and for that America compensated us $11.72. Would not even refund us our flights. I asked about compensation for the delays and their response was basically you made it home why are you complaining. $400 car rental, $150 gas bill and 10 hrs of our time and they think I\\'m a complainer for saying something. Never again.  I have never met ruder people in my entire life then the desk workers this company has greeting you. They don’t even pretend to care about your issue or help you reach your flight. A woman, who refused to give her name, walked away from me as I was asking a question. My main issue is that I was in 1st class, priority, and my bag didn\\'t arrive at my location! Was it because I got a free checked bag with priority? Because I got something free, it means we just don’t have to do our jobs? Absolutely appalling customer service skills. Something needs to be done. Seminars, workshops, I don’t know, anything to help these depressed looking individuals you put at the front helm of your business. I will be spending my vacation researching better airlines to use from now on. \\xa0 \\xa0AA has the worst customer service of any business I have ever interacted with. They cancelled one leg of my flight while I was at the airport. Offered me future travel credit because they could not rebook me same day. The advice the gate agent gave me was to \"drive\". And gave me an 800 number to call. I rented a car, called the number, and had the immense displeasure of speaking to a manager who asked me how I got the number and told me she could not reimburse me for the rental, could not refund my canceled flight and offered her advice of \"use the website\". So even though I was told to call the number and now my husband is driving a rental to try and get us to our connecting airport in time for the next flight she said she cannot do anything to help me. Now that I have looked at their website it is equally as helpful as destiny. I would love to talk to someone from AA who actually cares about people, if such a person is even employed there. If I could leave a 0/10 I would   I realized after booking that I needed to arrive in my destination city earlier that originally expected. American Airlines wouldn’t let me change my outbound flight due to the type ticket I bought, I accepted it and booked an earlier flight through another airline at my expense ... add $95. Out of curiosity I called AA to notify them that I wouldn’t need the outbound flight but would be on the scheduled return. They told me “if I wasn’t on my outbound flight I couldn’t take the inbound that I needed”. It’s my ticket and seat but if in not on the flight it’s considered a change. Long story “1hr 45 min” on the phone with customer service and I am now booking my return with another airline .. $118. Not sure what the restrictions are due to because I was able to save $10 booking two one way flights separately and only 5 days before the flight. I’ve flown for business for 18 years and have never had a good experience with AA. Small outdated planes, poor customer service, numerous delays and for what?   My girlfriend and I had originally booked tickets from New York (Take off 2:10 PM) to Nantucket (Landing 3:32 PM). We chose these flight times because it was on a weekday, and meant we were able to minimize our time offline from work. However, American Airlines forced a flight change, where we needed to fly out of New York at 12pm, travel via Washington, and only land at Nantucket at 4:43pm. This increased our travel time by 203 minutes, since the change did not stick to our original time constraints we requested a refund (or at least airline credit). However we received a response stating that we were not eligible for a refund because the forced changes by the airlines did not exceed 242 minutes (The original flight time was only 90 minutes to start with, and the changes would have made the travel time 283 minutes. That is 3.5x longer than we had originally purchased). I understand if that is their policy, but beware when flying with them, as this is an example where they have exercised their ability to significantly change your original flights without accountability or ability for a refund or even credit. Letter from American Airlines \"Thank you for contacting Customer Relations. My name is Emma and I\\'m here to help. I realize that schedule changes can be unexpected and are unwelcome, especially for those of us who carefully plan itineraries and count on the airline to operate as scheduled. Occasionally, we must realign flight schedules altogether for reasons such as equipment use or scheduled maintenance, gate arrival/departure slot changes, air traffic control restrictions, and Covid circumstances. In all cases, we try to work with our customers to minimize any inconvenience, and I regret we weren\\'t more successful this time. While I appreciate your request for a refund, your tickets do not qualify. In order to qualify, the schedule changes would have to exceed 241 minutes. They don\\'t. I am sorry for any further disappointment this causes. We appreciate you very much, Mark, and look forward to welcoming you and Breanna onboard your next American flight! Take care and stay well.\"   My special needs daughter was flying as a unattended minor UM special needs and was supposed to have escort services. Well she was abandoned by prospect and American at a gate in Chicago O’Hara airport where I had to fight 1000 miles away and advocate for her via phone to keep her in the airport with escort overnight. They tried sending her out to Chicago alone to a hotel. She’s speech impaired and has developmentally delays she cannot read or write. Most horrible experience I have ever gone thru. This airline is horrible! My daughter was traumatized being left and neglected in the Chicago airport.   I am a AA Credit Member. MAY 19, Sunday, my flight was delayed due to some type of crew error. The soonest flight would not arrive until May 20 at 10:00am. Due to having to work I will be unable to make that flight. I asked if there was a way to receive a rental car or travel credit for this flight, and I was told no to both, I also purchased an insured flight with. They would also not be able to refund the flight due to I was able to make the first flight; however the connecting flight was missed due to the delay. I really am disappointed with them and will never be booking with them again, forget the credit card and everything. No accommodations is so crazy to me. I have said my piece just so no one gets this same treatment. Please beware of the accommodations for things that are their fault.   I was traveling with a party of 7, including one mobility impaired senior, and two boys, under ten years old who are on the autism spectrum (and prone to unexpected violent outbursts). We proactively had all of us wearing name tags with the age on the 4 youths. The flight attendant was very attentive and friendly,-taking care to address each one of us by name. He made all of us (especially the little ones feel like royalty). I credit the flight attendant for making the children\\'s first airline flight to be pleasant and meltdown-free. I would give him 10 stars for his service. As for the overall \"first class\" experience, I would rate it a 7/10. About 10 years ago, the AA 1st class experience was noticeably different than coach. I paid the extra cost for all of the family, hoping to secure a designated 1st -class steward. I wish AA would go back to the special treatment, bigger seats, more leg room. However, overall, I believe that the flight attendant (I wish I had gotten his name), used his available resources to make the flight as premium as possible.   Ridiculous team work, terrible maintenance crew, and disorganized. We had a wonderful vacation with a connecting flight in Dallas TX. First of all security was incredibly rude literally yelling about everything. Our flight was delayed an hour and a half or so due to weather. We were basically last to board the plane. They did not do maintenance checks before boarding the plane, there was an error with an oxygen cap or something. Took maintenance forever to get over there, pilot tried to update passengers said probably a half hour. That passed, estimated another half hour so they could pick up a part, then another to complete paperwork. Then we did take off checks. Started taxi and light came on that the door was not sealed where they did the cap replacement took so long, then they were waiting for more help to back up the plane! By the time we took off we had boarded the plane for 3 hours. I traveled with small children who watched two movies during this time. I get there wasn’t much the crew could do but why weren’t these checks done before loading the plane, not to mention all that time during the weather delay. I felt like I was questioning how prepared the plane was to leave, with how maintenance had to come back and forth three times and couldn’t do the job completely the first time. My children and I are utterly exhausted our flight should have been 2.5 hours and we were on the plane 5plus. It was incredibly hot before take off, my feet were aching and swollen. I felt like my families time was not important to anyone. Again our flight crew was adequate. Obvious that whoever they were radioing to help was not helpful. What a waist of my life. I hope to never fly with you again.  I did not choose American - I know they are awful. It was attached to my Alaska Airlines flight. I had requested wheelchair assistance - it all went off without a hitch flying into Dallas - however there was a chair with no person to move said chair. And I’m being asked to produce a ticket I don\\'t have - I get a little louder and say “I do not have a ticket I need it printed at the Alaska gate”, the awful gate staff member starts on me - meanwhile the only person who comprehends the fact that I’m not flying American, they are just a filler airline is also being dismissed by staff member! It’s bad enough to fly when you are in pain, but to be demeaned by an ignorant member of staff is horrible!   Our flight out of Key West to Sacramento was cancelled on our way to the airport. When I called she acted like well all we have is in a couple days take it or leave it. We have no accommodations in Key West. Where are we supposed to sleep, at the airport. These airlines do not care if you are stranded cause they don’t have a full plane and then they blame it on weather. Our hotel was very close to the airport and planes were landing and taking off all morning. Shame on you American Airlines. You can take my advantage number and shove it cause I won’t be on another AA flight ever again.   Miami to Philadelphia. Worst airline experience ever! Flew them to the destination and back. The party that was traveling together got split up. They refused to assign our seats together. Then I was 3 pounds overweight on my check in bag and they charged me an additional $100 on top of the $30 that I paid to check it in the first place. Airline is nothing but a money grubbing business that does not care about its customers. I will never fly American Airlines again. Staff were constantly rude and seemed annoyed to answer questions. Chose another airline if you have the option.   I have been an elite member with AA for 10 years due to extensive business travel. I lost my status this year due to covid (less travel). I have 500 mile upgrades that AA will not let me use because I no longer have status. I went on a business trip this weekend and on my way back the flight was delayed (as per usual with AA) when we boarded they announced that they would only be serving beverages to first class and main cabin. So the cart went only to main cabin guest for refreshments. This was the most disgusting thing i have ever experienced with the airline. So they are late and only have beverages for certain people. I was shocked to see this. If you did not have a good seat you better not be thirsty. The flight was from Philadelphia to Miami.   Worst airline I have used. Flight delayed by hours. Kicked us off flight, unbeknownst to us and without consent, had to get put back on flight, had to rebook connecting flight due to delay. The staff attitude was, oh well, too bad. Rude and dismissive. No hotel reimbursement even though we had to rebook our connecting flight for the next day.  American airlines has no problem with changing gates at last minute and in Dallas it\\'s a huge airport, horrible customer service their answer is always every 2mins. check to see if gate has changed. We sat in the airport from 10am and right now the last flight back home is now at 855pm, we got the new tickets and when my wife sat down from the counter she went back to ask about which gate the person looked it up and the time changed that quick to 930pm departure, so as of now from 10am-930pm sitting in the airport with a small child (1yr daughter). Completely upset and frustrated with this airline, because they don\\'t care and no real customer service because they know that we\\'re stuck using these airlines because the prices are so expensive that they know we have no other real options for far traveling. While in the airport i witness them closing the door someone ran up saying that they need to get on that plane and the customer service person said that once the door is closed that they can\\'t let them on or she said she can\\'t open the door once it\\'s closed. We still don\\'t have a new gate # we were told to just check the board for the gate # about 730pm and keep checking until you board. I know they don\\'t care about me and my family because they have millions of people who use their airline daily, so if I don\\'t use them anymore they\\'re not going to miss me and my family. Times and gates always changing, you have been warned.   I was horrified to see that little to no social distancing practices were being followed. American claims that they enforce a policy where customers are required to wear masks throughout their flight. The woman next to me was not wearing a mask throughout the duration of the flight. She was not eating or drinking, and was otherwise capable of wearing one. The flight attendant walked by multiple times and even had a conversation with the woman, but from what I could hear never told her to wear her mask. There were several other people in the rows around me not wearing masks either. I found this ironic because American kept announcing that they had a mask policy before we got on the flight. There were many people who were also wearing masks around their chins or in other improper fashions. My flight was also very close to full capacity. I know that other airlines are at least skipping seats between customers to try and stick to CDC recommendations, but almost everyone was shoulder to shoulder with someone else. I felt very unsafe and anxious during the whole flight, especially because I was in such close proximity to those people not wearing masks. I will not be flying American again.   Without a doubt the worst airline I fly with. I travel weekly for work and normally have to fly American Airlines per my company\\'s request. Customer service is next level rude. Almost never have a flight where they don\\'t mess up my check bags one way or another. Only airline I\\'ve ever seen that seems to purposely treat Retired Military like second class people. If they can\\'t make an extra dollar off you they will absolutely do everything they can to get out of helping you in any way.   We flew to El Paso and back. on the way back they canceled my flight. I was forced to fight with the counter person until they put us on a United flight the next day. We had to spend the night eat out buy chargers ect. The counter person said \"I will not pay for the hotel\" I don\\'t understand. I contacted AA and they did nothing and will not answer my emails. How do you not answer emails? You can\\'t call because it takes hours to get anyone. Why would anyone fly with them? So all in all this change cost me hundreds of dollars. Also I had to take an emergency day off of work.   I had such a horrible experience recently. For starters, my departure flight was delayed. Then we took a detour to Texas in the middle of our route and had to land there to get on to another plane which delayed my trip for more than 3 hours as I was traveling to a business conference. After getting arriving 4 hours late, It still wasn\\'t the end. When it was time to take my returning flight, it was supposed to leave at 7:20 p.m. but then got delayed until 11:00, but then got delayed until 3:00 a.m. but then got delayed until 6:00 a.m. And then was completely canceled. I had to then out of pocket pay for a hotel for the night until the next day. By the time they rescheduled my flight the next day, they sent me an email 3 hours before departure stating this is your new flight. Not even giving me enough time to go. I sent several emails to customer relations to be compensated for this and the most that they can offer me was 12,500 miles, which isn\\'t even enough to take me to Orange county from JFK in the first place. Which which that was my round-trip flight. They also offer to send me a check for the price of the hotel night. But in reality when your flight has been completely canceled and significantly changed for over 4 hours, you are entitled to twice the price of the initial ticket. They didn\\'t even offer me half as much. I may never fly American again and I\\'m an AA member.   My son was booked out of Montreal to Raleigh Saturday morning. On Friday night, his flight from Montreal to LaGuardia was canceled - no reason given, presumably weather. They could not book him on another flight until 7 a.m. Monday morning. When he got to the airport Monday morning his COVID test was done incorrectly (his fault) but he was yelled at, had to pay $200+ for a new test, and then managed to miss his flight because of that and customs delays. It took several hours on hold on the phone to get another flight because no gate agents were available. The new flight went through Philadelphia with a 5.5 hour layover, and he had to pay for that - again, his fault, but if the original flight had not been canceled it wouldn\\'t have happened because there would have been time to deal with things. Now his flight from Philly is delayed. Across the board people have been at best unhelpful and at worst flat-out rude. On his trip TO Montreal, his 6 a.m. flight from Raleigh (first flight of the day) was delayed and he arrived at LaGuardia with about 20 minutes to make his connecting flight, had to run to the next gate and then had the gate agent and the ramp agent yelling at him and each other about whether to let him on. They did, but none of that was his fault and he didn\\'t need to be the one getting berated. I get that travel in the time of COVID is a nightmare and that people are horrendously rude. But a lot of people are just trying to get by, to follow the ever-changing rules, and to be polite. Things are confusing. Mistakes get made. How about not yelling at people for things that are not their fault? And how about not canceling flights for weather when the vast majority of flights into an airport at the same time are not canceled, meaning the weather really isn\\'t that big of a problem. This has been an incredibly awful experience throughout the trip. After I had a horrible experience with American flight cancellations a couple of years ago, we\\'re done with this airline.   First they seated my newly wedded wife and I two rows apart and refused to move us together and then they completely messed up our brand new $200 Disney 50th anniversary rolling suitcase  that we bought last night before flying home today and there is no way to contact them about it. I can’t put pics on their facebook page and their “contact” link on their site sends me straight back to their home page. We will never fly with them again.  We flew American Airlines from Phoenix to Portugal. We spent 3 weeks in Portugal and Spain. We flew back today from Barcelona. We just want to thank American Airlines because of the extremely helpful staff that they have all over the world. We had no idea how to navigate Barcelona Airport this morning. They made it so easy for us. It was our first time in Europe. We will definitely fly with American Airlines again. Thank you.   My flight A1171 was canceled due to broken Ac while we were inside the plane. Not only it was canceled we were rescheduled 3 times while being at the airport. At the end it was rescheduled to next day. As it was rescheduled for 24 hours later, I had to make sure my kids were safe and had a place to sleep. At the time it all happened it was passed 10 pm. American airline customer service didn\\'t provide any information and kept saying that next flight is tomorrow evening. Horrible service! No one reimbursed us for anything!   Plane was absolutely packed to the brim. Passengers even had oversized luggage stuffed in overhead. Could not understand flight attendant.  Boarding was completely unorganized. Especially with covid. People were on top of each other. Landing process was horrendous. Took forever. Weather was perfect. Never flying with them again. $12 if you want wifi for an hour. Ridiculous!   I have booked two flights last year. One I had to cancel because I got COVID but never received a refund and the other one was book accidently and after 5 mins I cancelled the flight but also never received a refund. Plus I have called their customer service many times and they were supposed to call me back but they never did!! So far this is the worst airline ever and I will never use them in the future.  I traveled with 4 kids total 5 tickets going to AMM.. on the counter served by a mean agent. We have only two luggage’s only for 5 tickets not even carry on baggage, one bag has 53 pounds, she gave us a very hard time, we almost missed our flight, it took more than 30 minutes while creating the boarding passes where as at the next counter people are moving and seeing bags 53, 54,55 pounds and people moving on. We travel two to three times every year, never had worse than today’s experience with Doris and Raja in DCA airport.  Rudest staff ever! Bad enough our flight got canceled for reasons undisclosed to us, we called to rebook our flight and the lady that assisted was extremely rude and condescending! We had to both miss work on Monday due to this delay. Spent an hour and a half on the phone, mostly on hold, waiting to be rebooked. Then we weren’t able to get a direct flight as previously scheduled and we didn’t get the seats we paid extra for to accommodate for extra leg room as my fiancé is 6’5”. Then we didn’t get to even sit together. To top it off, going through security, every person we dealt with was unnecessarily rude! Then they mixed our personal belongings with other peoples bins! I did not appreciate my phone and purse being placed in another person’s bin! Completely ridiculous! Will never fly American again!!   Flight left Chicago two and a half hours late. No explanation other than mechanical. No updates on status just changed departure time by 30 minutes once the departure time listed arrived. Clerks working the gate left and went home and left the gate closed and passengers had no person to contact and ask questions. Finally left Chicago and arrived in Austin two and a half hours after scheduled time. Sat on tarmac for 20 minutes waiting on a gate so we could deplane.   \\r\\nAbsolutely horrendous experience. We arrived to the airport and boarded quickly. On the runway the plane broke down, we spent an hour just sitting on the plane waiting for our next direction. We were finally taken off the plane and told there was a slight delay that would only take an hour. This delay happened a total of 6 times! All in all, we ended up waiting 11 hours at the airport for them to finally get the plane running. Two flight attendants running out of the boarding gate refused to stay on the flight. Flight cancelled and no more flights until Friday. A very nice man found one spot for us to rebook, but made us aware of the 75% chance we would even get to board. We are taking the chance. I’m writing this review whilst sitting in an uncomfortable chair at an airport waiting for my 9:00 pm. Flight that was supposed to happen at 7 am. I got a 12 dollar food voucher as compensation for waiting 11 hours. I guess it is better than nothing.   I had $1900 out-of-pocket expenses American is refusing to reimburse me for. I have been a customer of American Airlines (AA) for many years; I hold a Premium AAdvantage Card (with over 110K points) and I also hold an Admiral\\'s Club Card as well. On 8/14/21 I was on vacation with my family (wife and two children) returning home. It started off with the flight from Savannah to Charlotte. We were supposed to depart at 12:43pm, with a connecting flight to Boston at 3:02pm. The flight kept getting delayed (and terminals moved) and we did not take off until almost 2:45pm (Already missing connecting flight). On top of that, the aircraft had a poorly working ground Air Conditioner (87 degrees outside; did not work well in the air as well). We were then diverted to Willington NC due to a ‘pop-up’ storm. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 HOURS with no ground A/C. Finally, they moved us to a terminal; where we sat for another 3hrs. We then attempted to get a secondary flight home (since we missed our connecting flight) and we were given the “OPTION” of flying back to Boston 2 ½ days later, which would be the ‘earliest flight’ for four people. To make it home on-time for work, we booked with another airline (4 tickets). We finally took-off and got back to Charlotte at 10pm. American Airlines gave us no information when we landed, nor was there anyone to give us direction after landing so late. We rented a hotel room and paid for an uber to/from the hotel. (We also had to pay for additional day of parking and a day of kennel for my dog after finally making home). This mistake of American Airlines cost me in total $1,900.00 because of the original delay of flight (weather was fine up until our LATE landing point). I filed paperwork online with AA Customer Relations. I was contacted by AA customer relations (after two weeks after putting in a ‘complaint’ and request for reimbursement) and they informed me that “Only the hotel would be reimbursed; we do not cover other ‘out-of-pocket’ expenses, since they offered me a flight home 2 ½ days later.   I booked an $800 flight to Cancun in April 2021. I was paralyzed in a traumatic accident in May 20 21. Originally, American Airlines give me a flight credit that said I had to book by April 2022. I\\'m in a power wheelchair, able to walk, at the young age of 29. I reached out to American airlines, hoping for a refund or a partial refund. I\\'m now on disability, and $800 is a lot of money and could help me financially. I explained my full situation to American Airlines, impressing upon them that I am in no condition to fly anytime soon. They extended my flight credit until September of this year. That\\'s only six months away. Not only am I physically incapable of flying anytime soon, but I also have no intention of booking any upcoming trips. People with disabilities already have a difficult time getting accommodations when it comes to flying. I\\'m not asking for any extreme special treatment, only the basic consideration of my situation. For such a public and high-value customer to completely overlooked my plate, is detrimental to the disabled community as a whole. American Airlines, do better.   The Wi-Fi is so poor on the plane. It doesn\\'t let you know that your flight has been delayed until you get down in. You can turn your phone on to find out that hey your place delayed by 7 hours and then with the Wi-Fi you can try and book another flight but it\\'s probably not going to happen as it just spins around and spins around because there\\'s no good Wi-Fi in the airport at all. This is in Philadelphia. There\\'s hardly any place like your phone in as well and this isn\\'t the c terminal which is also not in numerical order. Then they offer me a couple different flights back to Boston but one of them was going to Providence which is not really anywhere near. I live and like I would have to drive 2 hours home from there. Then they give me another updated flight that I could get on and then I am trying to sign into it. But the Wi-Fi is not good so couldn\\'t get that flight and by the time I could it said that it was filled. I\\'m not getting any kind of anything back from them. They\\'re not a good airline. There\\'s no people that are at the gates. Apparently everybody works for only fans right now and you know that\\'s it. There is no customer service.   The personnel at the boarding area are rude. I complained to a supervisor and her excuse was that it was busy. Supervisors should make sure all employees are friendly   Terrible experience! I booked my ticket via phone to confirm Covid restrictions. While on the phone proceeded to book my ticket for my spring break in March. The customer service representative and I started talking about sharing a birthday month in May. After reviewing my date in the email noticed it was the wrong month (May instead of March). I called back and was put on hold for 2.5 hours. When I spoke with a representative she told me it would be an addition 173 dollars. I told her it was not my mistake and should be on the recording. She put me back on hold for an additional 15 minutes to speak with her supervisor. When the supervisor answered he said “sorry man, there is nothing I can do. Absolutely unacceptable!   On the trip out, they lost my luggage and I was stuck waiting on the airport for 6 hours for my suitcase. On the way back, multiple hour delay in Orlando. There was only one flight out of Charlotte, and I had allowed a lot of time to ensure I would make that connection. But, the delay was too great. American would not hold the connecting flight, even though it was the last flight out and they would only have had to wait about 15 minutes for us. So, I was stuck overnight. They sent me to a hotel with a voucher with someone else\\'s name, which I didn\\'t notice. Then, they spoke directly to the hotel and invalidated my voucher after I was showered and settled in. They didn\\'t contact me directly at all and refused to take my calls. The hotel told me American Airlines said I \"didn\\'t qualify for a hotel voucher.\" So, being trapped overnight doesn\\'t get you a hotel? So, I had to pay out of pocket for a hotel to which they had sent me. Garbage airline with rude workers. When I was stuck overnight by Southwest last year, they gave hotel vouchers out without any question at all. So, this is specifically American Airlines that treats people this way. Also, to get me back, they sent me on a flight with yet another connection, so 7 more hours of flying when the flight they made me miss was half that, not to mention the layover at LaGuardia that I really didn\\'t want to have. A whole day lost and I had to pay out of pocket for the privilege. I think American Airlines forgets that the citizens bailed them out with tax dollars.   American Airlines has worst customer service. We have an tkt worth $200 from year 2020. They didn’t extended the credit saying it’s non-refundable. On year 2020, they gave us travel vouchers saying this can be used and will be extended now they are saying something different. The customer representative was so rude. I am asking my own money and asking to use it in my other flight but they said they can’t. Just tricking innocent people. Please try to ignore flying American Airlines as possible. Worst airline   Very unhappy that flight AA1445 from DFW to Boise was cancelled instead of postponed. But 5 stars to Rebecca Feliciano at gate A23 for finding the best replacement flight, AA 1482, and arranging check in bags to be transferred to right plane. She is very patient and helpful. Edit, through no fault of Rebecca\\'s this flight was delayed, delayed, delayed, oh just kidding, cancelled too. So there was no longer any point in going to Boise, because I would not arrive in time for the conference. So nothing left but to try to return home as soon as possible. There were no available AA flights to Atlanta that night (Sat 14 Aug) or the next day (Sun 15 Aug), so I went by Delta instead, and even this flight was almost booked out. And now there is a struggle to get my suitcase back with my medicines and CPAP machine. On Saturday night (14 Aug), asked Faisal at baggage information to retrieve my bag. He said 45 min to 5 hours. I waited about three hours then had to leave. In the morning, went to baggage information to look. Was told to go to American Airlines help desk. Cynthia told me frankly that they could not get the back to me, but would sent it to Atlanta on the next available flight. Then they would deliver it to my house. So went to the American Airlines baggage office in Atlanta airport. No luck. But the man there told me that he had put yet another request to sent to Atlanta. Yet he didn\\'t think Now I check the luggage tracker, and they have sent it on to Boise although they had cancelled TWO flights there. Also, he didn\\'t think they had to deliver it to my house because I returned home by another airline (1. There were no flights because all booked out. 2. How would I know that they wouldn\\'t be cancelled too, after repeated delays?). One would think that since AA stuffed up so monumentally, they would be bending over backwards to make it right. Also it was apparently beneath the dignity of management stuff to help out customers in hard cases. My health is at risk because AA seems to be going out of its way not to return my property to me!! I am writing the latest part of this as I have been on hold for 1 hour 10 minutes. If I could give AA fewer than one star, I would. I am far from the only customer put out badly by this incompetence and lack of service, and unwillingness to fix THEIR mistakes. But if you want a high risk of flight cancellation and luggage loss, AA is for you!   I have never had a worse experience with an airline than the one I had with American Airlines today. We arrived at the airport hours before our flight only to have it delayed twice. We eventually boarded the plane, only to be told 30-40 minutes later that the flight was cancelled and we had to disembark because the first officer never showed up. We were then told to wait in line to rebook our flight at the gate. We waited in line for over 2 hours to rebook our flight, only to be “assisted” by a rude American Airlines employee who clearly didn’t know how to help us in the least. Getting her to help us rebook, find our luggage, and get compensated for a hotel (after we rebooked we had an overnight layover) was way harder than it should have been. If there were more employees at the gate to help with the disaster that resulted from the flight cancellation, we could have been on our way to our destination hours earlier. Will never fly with American Airlines ever again, and will never recommend the airline to anyone.   SDF to DFW was delayed because the plane struck a bird on arrival. This caused me and my girlfriend to miss our connection to Portland. They made up for this by booking us a flight to Phoenix. No connections, just a flight to Phoenix. I can only hope they intended to purchase a complimentary house in our name. After reaching out to customer service, we were told the only way we could travel home together was if we stayed overnight and took the first American Airlines flight to LAX, and then they booked us an Alaskan Airlines ticket to PDX from there. We made it to LAX, but got rejected at boarding for our flight to Portland because I was given a boarding pass with no actual ticket. After LAX staff sent me all over the place not knowing where their own airlines were, American assigned us another Alaskan flight, for 8 hours out. At the time of writing, I\\'m still waiting. We had to stay overnight at a hotel in Dallas, and now we have to spend our day waiting in LAX for a flight. Next time, I\\'ll book Alaskan. God help anybody who dares book American.   We booked 5 tickets on American Airlines. Two were 1st class and three were Economy with additional charges for the premium seating. The initial leg of our flight to Charlotte was cancelled due to mechanical problems. Originally, while we were already boarded, they announced that the flight was not going to take off, but they had no idea on what the resolution would be. When we deboarded the plane, American told us there was no way they were getting us to Charlotte for our connecting flight, and there were no other flights available. The only resolution the gate agents could give us, was that they would get us to our vacation destination 24 hours later. While we were trying to find better options with the agent, my son found a flight departing out of Washington DC. The agent volunteer to book this for us. I assumed that our original flight charges would be refunded and I would be recharged for the new flight. After several email communications with American, we received $175 for each of the two 1st class tickets, and a $25 flight credit for each of the economy tickets. The difference between the original ticket price and the new flights was over $2000. So far, American has responded to two of my emails, and the second was simply thank you for your comments. They say they have \"world class customer service\" but I can\\'t get anything but canned responses. Our 1st class seats were exchanged for basic economy tickets on United Airlines. and the economy tickets with premium seats were exchanged for basic economy seats also. I understand the premium seating purchases are non-refundable, but I truly believe that if the plane does not fly, I should not be charged for the seats! We also had a $160 baggage charge that would have been covered with our 1st class tickets, and since our new flight departed from an airport 2 hours away, we also had to expense a rental car for $150. American Airlines are taking the stance that since they got us to Cancun, we are not entitled to any more refunds. I also now understand, that if I had just allowed American to cancel my original flight, I would have been fully refunded for the charges, but since their agent booked the flight for me, American feels they are due the entire amount of my fees. Trust me, I have learned a valuable lesson and going forward, I will always rebook my own tickets. And flying American will no longer be my first choice!   Flew down to visit my parents. Arriving flight was late to arrive and late to disembark, made me late for my connection and I the missed my flight. Next flight wasn’t until 10:45, stranded at the airport and was only given a 12 dollar meal voucher. Flight continued to give updates from 10:45 to 01:00 the next day. Customer service could offer no further assistance.   I had a flight booked for March to take a cruise out of Miami. The cruise was cancelled. I re-booked for December. The airfare was a total (for 3 of us) a savings for us at $217.50. I had to fight for the credit to my credit card for the pre-paid seats, which I finally received. I called many times to get the credit for the difference in airfare credited to my credit card. I never received a call back from a \"manager\", and even emailed the CEO three times to get a credit rather than a voucher, which I can never use before the expiration date. Contrast to Delta, they were so nice and did whatever was needed to accommodate the disruption caused by covid. Will never use them again!   The flight attendants are the rudest and most unprofessional of all. I have flown all different airlines, but out of all, American Airlines is the worst. One flight attendant spilled leftover food on me but did not even apologize. Instead, she handed me paper towels and demanded me to pick up the ones on the floor. I asked if I could have a pen to fill out customs form and another flight attendant said, \"Do we look like we carry extra pens? We don\\'t.\" I also saw an Asian grandmother getting asked, \"Do you understand or speak English?\" with the rudest tone. What kind of diverse \"American\" Airlines is this? I will never use this airline again.   We flew American down to Roatan. The flight down was ok it was overbooked and the staff tried to sell us a credit card that was not worth the annual fee. The pilot was very nice and it was to be expected for an economy seat. However the boarding process is illogical and stupid boarding customers who paid for a seat before those who did not regardless of seat position. We were in 15E and F and we boarded after someone seated in the back and front of the plane. As a result it was sheer chaos getting on board. I know they want to make money but lets all save time and just board front to back or back to front like ever other logical airline. Mythbusters had an entire episode about this but clearly the CEOs of AA do not watch anything other than thier bank accounts. On the way back it gets worse we were delayed 4 hours because the airplane decided to take a nap in Miami. I have no idea why it takes 4 hours to service an airplane and how you know it will be delayed 9 hours before you board and still are not able to do anything but rebook a person on a flight that is overnight in a totally different city and not the one that they land in for the flight that leaves the next day. Again defies logic. I have been delayed before but at least there was a reason needless to say I will not be flying AA again. This is coming from someone has flown Ryanair many times.   I want to thank Dwayne, he was working at the kiosk helping people with their tickets. I had back surgery and this gentleman was able to change my seat because I cannot walk a lot. The person that was supposed to help me with the wheelchair never came and he just took me to the plane without waiting for nobody. I think he is a great asset to this company. My flight was AA 952 on Dec 6, 2021 from Philadelphia to DFW. Love people like this gentleman.   I\\'m having a terrible experience. I bought tickets from SCL to Montego bay which had a stop on Miami. We were supposed to depart at 21:55. The flight was delayed until 23:00, and later once again delayed until 00:00. At 00:30 with no other information we Are informed that the flight is cancelled due to maintenance. AA got us meal vouchers to use at the airport and moved us to a hotel in Santiago. They moved us by bus at 2:00 am while only one bus was making the round trip to pick us all.. we waited hours at -1°C with no shelter. Next day, with no notice whatsoever to me AA picked up everybody BUT me from the hotel to the airport at 14:30. I had to go by myself by uber at 15:00. At the AA counter there were only 2 people working and the whole group of the cancelled flight had to wait in line until 18:30 The rescheduled flight was supposed to fly at 19:20 now.. it was a few minutes delayed. At the counter and because they were in a hurry, they didn\\'t arranged my connection flight to montego bay but only saw that i could get to miami and \"they will help you there\" At an AA counter in Miami they put me in a flight to Montego bay that leaves at 8:00 -  the flight was overbooked. Now they put me in a waiting list for the next flight but with no certainty that i will make the flight, So far i have lost 2 days of my honeymoon vacation, spent 2 taxi fares, had had a couple meals to survive and have no idea when and if i am going to get to Jamaica finally. The official response of AmericanAir is: \"As a token of our apology, I have credited miles to your AAdvantage® account\" which they added to an account that is not mine by mistake. Meanwhile I\\'m spending my honeymoon and work leave at airports pushed from line to line with no notice of arriving at my destination. I\\'m very, very upset and disappointed. Update: they assigned me to another waiting list at a flight to Montego bay at 11:00 am and with no surprise to me, again overbooked. Later they assured me seats at a flight at 18:50 but now destination Kingston \"best i can do\" And when i thought i could finally get to Jamaica, the flight was delayed and now canceled until tomorrow 5 am ... 3 days vacation wasted on airport lines (not to mention lost reservations, no access to my checked baggage, no shower) and @AmericanAir haven\\'t even said sorry.   I been trying to get home for 2 days had to stay another night at a $700 resort bc they kept pushing my flight back the canceled it do to maintenance problem and wasn\\'t offered nothing or compensated at all for the inconvenience it now its the next day and I\\'m stuck in NC and the same thing is happening again and now I\\'m going to miss my son first ever game when this flight was book months ago!! Never fly American, fly delta or United if something does happen with them atleast they care  This has to be the worst airline experience ever. I will never ever fly with them again. They acted completely cold and uncaring. They promise one thing on the phone and then say another in person. They do not provide any assistance for people flying alone with small children (where as all other airlines do). I should not be crying in the middle of the airport due to how I’m being treated. Don’t promise and not deliver that is bad business. The only good thing about my trip was a handful of flight attendants that were kind enough to help me.   I was stranded in the El Paso airport due to delayed/cancelled flights because of the Dallas weather. Employees of American Airlines were fantastic in dealing with the chaos of rebooking flights. They were all calm, polite, and friendly. When I finally made it to the front of the line, the woman who helped me was exceptional and spent a long time figuring out the best way to get me home. I think her name was Carmen or something? If she reads this - the gamble worked and my connecting flight was also delayed!   The day before my flight I got an email from American to arrive 2 hours early (domestic flight). I arrived 1.5 hours early and there were no agents at the counter and lights and computers weren’t even on for 15 more min. When we board the plane we get told that there is a part messed up and they have to fix it and keep updating us saying “ten more minutes”. 2 hours later we are told to deplane. I spent 3 hours standing in line to wait to talk to an agent to rebook (and I did try to do it online and it said the sight was experiencing problems). When we finally rebooked we are rushed on and I had 30 min to connect at the next airport. We then spend 40 min on the plane because they are having issues with checked bags, even though at this point they have had 4 hours plus to figure out the bag situation. When we eventually leave and land at the next airport I run to the terminal for my next flight which was only two terminals down from where we landed and the plane had already closed and no agent in sight. We arrived at the gate 12:15 and the plane was supposed to leave at 12:30. I have had other airlines wait for customers when they know it has been extenuating circumstances but not American. We then stand in another line for 20 minutes (relatively fast) and get booked on the next flight and the agent has the audacity to tell me that his “tip” would be to arrive to my gate 30 minutes early so I don’t miss my flight. I am flying with my mother and she is on standby so only one of us will get there potentially. I will do my best to never fly this airline again.  Puerto Rico to Heathrow via Charlotte. American Airlines planes are great, shame about the staff. Very rude to passengers, when you ask a question you will be told: “I was actually on my break\"! Food was not great for a long flight. Totally spoiled the holiday, I will avoid in future.   Worst airline I have ever flown. Not once have they ever left on time or not had any issues with their horribly maintained aircrafts. They have no regard for your timeline. I do not recommend this airline for business professionals who need to get places on a timely manner.  Multiple flights were delayed due to weather and eventually cancelled due to staffing shortages - which is a SERVICE FAILURE by American Airlines. We had to book a hotel and rent a car to travel home more than 10 hours to get home to our young daughter where we also had to adjust child care. When we spoke to a customer service representative about some sort of reimbursement for our more than $500 of unplanned travel expenses and explain our situation, we were met with a cold, unhelpful, patronizing, and dismissive person who clearly had a script and was not willing to help us out at all. I was surprised that a service industry professional would be so unwilling to provide us with some sort of retribution for our troubles that we clearly outlined as more involved than a simple weather cancellation. If this is not resolved in an equitable manner then I will never fly American Airlines again and vehemently recommend no one else fly this airline as well.  American Airlines customer service is absolute trash. I flew home Monday from Chicago, finally, after 6 delays and 9 hours worth of waiting. The delays were not weather related. I finally made it home after 1 am from a flight that was supposed to arrive at 4:15pm, only to find my luggage was still in Chicago. I filed a claim and was told it is typically 24 hours for bags to be returned. It is now day 4 and my bag has not even moved from where it has been since Monday (I have an AirTag). The customer service has been a joke. Every person has different answer and none have any above them I can speak to. The last person was incredibly rude to my wife and told her “She must have a misconception of what their baggage claim department does.” They are all so beyond useless, I don’t even know why they employ people there. The only people seemingly willing to help is the ones we reached out to on social media. It is now the 4th day of not having my luggage. I have paid $700 out of pocket to replace a medical device that is in my luggage. I spend a ton of money with this airline traveling for my sons hockey, and I can’t believe the customer service has been this poor. I am currently looking into taking my business elsewhere because of this entire experience.   Had a morning flight at 630 to Charlotte then another to Pensacola. Aircraft problems made me rebook flights multiple times to varying destinations to try and get in the vicinity of where I needed to go. I could have driven there In 6.5 hours. My flight has been pushed back about 8 hours now and I\\'m still in the airport and have been here for 10 hours. I got a refund and will drive because I can get there faster and cheaper than waiting around and not reaching my destination for 18 hours. Find another airline and don\\'t waste your money with American.  The worst airline by far and this is coming from someone who has been around the world several times. As I write this, been stuck for 4 hours on the ground in a small airport in Montrose, CO because they could not get a hold of their mechanic to solve a trivial issue. Restaurant is closed, snack bar is closed, many families stranded here for hours and American has not offered one person a bottle of water. Disgusting company that only cares about themselves, never again.  Just no. Gate agent wouldn’t let me check my bags because “you need to check them in one hour prior to boarding” then they put me on the defect flight to South Bend (was originally catching a connection at Fort Worth), agent wouldn’t look into other airlines for a flight, and instead put me on a flight boarding at 10, and they diverted in a fog Delta managed to land a flight in, made us spend in hour in Chicago, and still didn’t get us to where we needed to go. Flight attendant had an attitude problem.   We booked 2 round trip tickets to Austin from Seattle. The return flight was cancelled. We called American Airlines and was told the only flights leaving to Seattle were going out of Dallas, which was in the process of being flooded by a flash flood. We were told no flights were available leaving Austin. Before we realized that all flights leaving Dallas were being cancelled, we accepted a flight out of Dallas. Then we got word they were all being cancelled and went on line and found an American Airlines flight out of Austin so booked it and drive to the airport. Once there, we were told the AA flight out of Austin didn’t actually exist. They booked us on an Alaska Airlines flight to get back home and charged us two return flight tickets. We were told we wouldn’t be charged for the return flights from Dallas, but that was a lie. We were charged for two round tickets and two separate tickets to actually get back home. We tried to get a refund for the return flights on the round trip that never happened and are getting the run around. The only way to submit for it is to have the airline ticket numbers, which we don’t have because they were sent electronically and are no longer accessible. Part of the problem was Priceline, who booked the Austin flight that didn’t actually exist. We are never choosing American Airlines again. Not worth the “savings!”   The review is 1 in a scale from 1 to 10. The people who answer the phone do not care about the clients at all. They charge for a change in a flight $300 plus a lot of more money. I find very insensitive the personnel and primary the policy of American Airlines. I will not use this airline any longer when I buy a ticket. There are many other airlines who have a heart and care about their passengers.  Philadelphia to Punta Cana. Literally the worst experience EVER. I fly quite frequently and have never experienced such incompetence. I don’t know it it is just the Philadelphia employees who are notoriously rude and unhelpful or what. We are 2 adults flying with 2 young children (ages 8 & 5). When we purchased our seats, we chose 2 & 2 so there was 1 parent with 1 child. However, when we checked in, we were separated from our children. First, we tried the online chat, that person merely told us our assigned seats, which we already knew since that was what we were calling about. Then we called the customer service line and were told we had to talk to the person at the airport. When we arrived at the airport, we checked our bag through and our passports were scanned. We were not given paper tickets nor told we needed them AND were told we needed to speak to the person at the gate about our seats. We waited and waited for gate personnel. When they finally arrived they just started boarding. We finally got to the front of the line and were told “5 yr olds can sit alone.” This is unacceptable. They expect and think it’s ok for a child in kindergarten to sit next to a complete stranger. Then as we were boarding we were told our passports were not “verified.” Ummm, what? YOU scanned them! Such incompetence is astounding. If I practiced with such incompetence in my job, people would die. Once on board, every single family was separated from each other. It was pure chaos as people attempted to make seat switches. It was like a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces. It seems all of this could have been avoided if families were seated together to begin with. When purchasing tickets, the birthdates of the passengers must be entered. Seems like they could figure this problem out easily with a simple algorithm. There is no “AAdvantage” to flying American Airlines.   Flight 533 was supposed to take off at 6.56pm however it has now been delayed to 11.30pm because there is no pilot. Not only is this unacceptable but the Supervisor and his co-worker took my bag with my asthma medication and put it under the plane and refused to give it back to me stating it was too late.   I went on another American trip to see family in Richmond, VA back in late May/early June of 2022. In general, this trip was a lot better than my trip to Nassau in November and my trip to the Turks and Caicos in March (not because I flew internationally on those trips.) There are no nonstop flights from AUS to RIC, so on my outbound flight, I connected through Charlotte (CLT). The flight from Austin to Charlotte was good, but the flight from Charlotte to Richmond got delayed by an hour and a half due to weather. The airline did not communicate this until we got to gate C3 (our scheduled gate) in CLT. They didn\\'t tell us, but the flight leaving from C3 also got delayed because of severe weather in Oklahoma City. It took the airline one hour to realize gate C2 (the gate across from C3) was open, but because of this the plane left 30 minutes early than the delay said. American also failed to update the app on new departure times until it left, which confused some passengers. The return trip was a lot smoother: only this time we connected in Dallas (DFW). This time, they told us how to get around DFW and the SkyLink system to get around, which we used to get to our connecting gate to Austin. Both flights were on time. Customer service was better than our departing trip. Although American Airlines had poor communication, it was a pleasure flying, like always.   We booked our trip in March 2020, before the pandemic had really arrived. We ended up deciding not to cancel, partly wanting not to take money away from the already struggling travel business. Originally we had a direct flight there and also the return with seats together. A month prior to our trip, we were informed, not only would we not have a direct flight, there would be a layover and also the departure time was a few hours earlier, and we would, with the layover, be arriving over an hour later. When we decided to go ahead with the flights, we at that time had heard the middle seat in each aisle would be open to avoid close contact with others. Our together seats were also not the same. When we boarded, this was the first we saw that this was not the case. This airline had not only abandoned the empty middle seat, but had also combined many flights to ensure it was completely full, possibly over filled. Completely ignoring the possible spread of germs to make more money. While we were on our trip we received many many emails asking us if we wanted to switch our flights to longer flights, to avoid the extremely full flight home. These were all with much longer layovers, or not available when we clicked the link to find which flights were available. The other couple we were traveling with, and had carpooled with, let us know the day before we were to leave, that they had been moved, without being consulted, to entirely other flight home, at several hours earlier. In order to continue traveling with them, and to carpool home, we also had to switch to their new flights. The layovers were supposed to be an hour or more, but the flights took off late, and we had to literally run to catch our connection flights. On the flight home, we were boarding in Dallas FW, the agents at the gate took one look at us and said we had to now check our bags, even though they were the correct carry on size. She said they simply did not have any more room in the overhead storage, and was extremely rude when we had to think if we had any items in our bag that could not be checked, such as batteries, etc. We were not expecting to check our bags so we said we were not sure. They got louder and even more rude, continuing to ask us this. Finally we said we did not think so, we were pretty sure. So now we had to check our bags, and wait for them to arrive when we were supposed to have been able to store them like everyone else. When we did board, we saw many places our bags would fit in the open overheads, and also saw many other passengers board AFTER us happily storing their bags, this continued until we finally took off, late as usual. On each of the four flights we took on this trip, we saw several passengers who would not cover their nose with their masks, or some their mouths. The flight attendants made several announcements but did NOT actually enforce this. To sum up the issues I had with American Airlines, canceling our direct flights for layovers which were not timed well, the plane being full to over capacity with no regard to germ spread, not enforcing full mask wearing, excessive changes to our flights and times (having to deal with this while we were to be enjoying our trip), insisting we could not carry on our bags as we had always done in the past. Completely ignoring the issues of close contact with others, all just for profits. We will never fly American Airlines again. Delta, JetBlue, Alaska are far superior in every way.   American Airlines is bottom of the barrel. Of 14 flight legs in the past 2 years, 6 have made it on time, and 5 have been 3 hour plus delays. They destroyed my surfboards and lost my luggage as well. They used to be a midgrade airline, but they have gone downhill in the past 2 years. Do not use AA.   The worst ever experience! Charged me double for a bag, which I found out accidentally checking my online bank. I sent them an email, nobody ever contacted me. Trying to call them now, waiting forever. In Cartagena everything was not organized, staff don\\'t speak English. After the plane landed we spent another hour just waiting for a parking space.   Late coming to Tulsa and returning from Tulsa. Missed both connecting flights due the airplane being late. Had to take flights 3hours later. The most horrible airline ever. I will never  fly this airline again.   I truly believe it’s the worst airline ever. I will never ever take an aa flight. It’s the second trip this year with them. First to the Caribbean, now to Europe. Both times the flights delayed. No answers, no one knows if you will be flying or not. This trip, flights DCA to PHL / PHL to DCA were done in really small airlines forcing the passengers to check the carry ons. With almost no notice so a lot of us had to carry our computers during the flight. They are terrible organizing seats. Most families were separated during check in, and recommended by the on land employees to switch places once in the plane. Terrible in every aspect. Finally, half of the crew is usually really rude.   This airline is less than desirable. They delayed a flight that has been booked for months because they\\'re unprepared. Plane maintenance? Run real fast in the next terminal. Are you for real? People pay money to go where they\\'re going. They need to get there.  That\\'s a thing, a necessity. How about cognitive business thought from a multibillion shouldn\\'t he an afterthought.   Pittsburgh to Oklahoma City via Dallas. American Airlines was on time, smoothly boarded both planes, hassle free flight with no delays! The staff were courteous and friendly. They offered and drink and snack on the flight from Pitt to Dallas, on the OKC just a drink.   Absolutely horrendous environment. I had signed up for text message notifications and updates but it had not updated me that my flight had changed. By the time i figured out which gate I was suppose to be at, I was a few minutes too late. Customer service proceeded to tell me it was my fault even though their text message services were said to update me when flights change their terminals. No compensation, just another flight 17 hours later. Not to mention their planes are hot with a tiny ac fan that blows coldish air.   Went with the cheapest flight to my destination. You get what you pay for. First off, the website to book the flight was down. Had to call and sit on hold before booking the flight over the phone. Once on the plane, the attendants tell you to socially distance yourself if possible yet they pack every seat with a person. Their flight free entertainment app did not work and I did not want to pay $13/hr for the assumably poor WiFi. Once I arrived to catch my connecting flight, the sky bridge to unload malfunctioned. Then the connecting flight was delayed 2 hours because the crew wasn’t at the airport. Pay a few extra bucks to fly with a reputable airline.   Due to their delays, cancelations, horrible customer service, incompetence, and indifference I’ve lost over $1,500 having to book new flights, extending hotel stays, extending car rentals, and paying cab fees because the airline got us to our destination when the car rental company had already closed. This was an expensive lesson to learn, but I’ll never fly American Airlines again even if my life depended on it.   My experience with American Airlines over the last two months has been nothing short of exhausting. I booked a flight for a work trip and then a few months later left that company. I called AA to cancel said flight and book two tickets for an upcoming flight which would result in leftover credit from the original trip. I was never sent a confirmation that the original flight was cancelled, or record of my trip credit. It took 3 calls over the course of 4 weeks to even confirm that our tickets had been booked, as each rep told me the previous rep did not press the right keys, but now they were booked, only to find invalid record locators for our flights. The night before our flight it appeared that our seats had disappeared. After a 4.5 hour call at 10pm, with the rep hysterically laughing that our flight no longer had seats and she could not use our credit, we finally figured out our tickets. Now, I am trying to book flights with the remaining balance and it has been next to impossible. I spent 2 hours on the phone with a rep this morning trying to find my flight credit with an email I received on June 1 (finally) listing my trip credit number. Even though my email was received on June 1 and noted that it was issued on June 1, I was repeatedly told that was invalid credit and was issued and used on May 20th. Not accurate. Finally I was reissued a travel credit and assured it would be an easy booking process when I called back. Here I am, on hold again for 30 minutes now because the rep cannot find the new credit number they issued or the travel credit at all. This process has not only been a gigantic waste of time (at least 12 hours on the phone at this point) but also infuriating that the errors and mistakes of AA’s booking process have become my own massive problem  Pros - Great seat, spacious 1-2-1 layout. Flagship lounge at JFK is very good - proper food and drink selection. Cons - Inedible food on board. Breakfast comprised of watery scrambled eggs. Dinner was tough beef / lamb. Well below biz class standards of asian carriers and Delta. Cons - Rude on board staff. On the GIG - JFK leg, the cabin steward did not interact with me at all - no eye contact, surly service, no thanks for flying with them, extremely rude to another passenger in front of me. Again well below expectations of a biz class ticket. Rude staff at the AA Admirals Club check in.    We had a delayed flight from Portland to Dallas, which caused us to rebook a flight and wait in the Dallas airport for 10 hours. There were 4 of us who asked for a reimbursement and Courtney was so helpful at providing that for us. However, American Airlines would only provide $12 for the inconvenience! That’s not even enough to cover a side of fries at the airport! Very disappointed in American, but Courtney was very helpful!   I look forward to never flying this airline again. Perpetually late. They lie about the punctuality of their flights in their status emails. The flights are cramped, dirty, and they smell and they lie about things like one bag being included when they nickel and dime you.   American Airlines is probably one of the most unprofessional, disorganized airlines I’ve ever flown with. The people working the flight were rude, my flights were delayed twice for reasons they still can’t explain. And they are no help at all with their customers and the questions they have about flights they [aid for. This makes me never want to fly with airline again. I’ve had better experience with Spirit. And That’s saying something.   A never ending nightmare! My flight from Dallas to London was cancelled for technical reasons 10 minutes before boarding. I obviously lost my connection to Berlin. It was 11pm, hundreds of people in the line to get rebooked on another flight, only 4 people from the staff were working. After hours of frustration and waiting in the line, American Airlines announced they will close the counter. At 1.30am they left all the remaining passengers at the airport without providing for an Hotel voucher, food or the possibility to get re-booked. They said they would open again at 6am. At 5.30am the line is already huge, at 6.30am still none is there to work. Finally a girl calls the assistance asking where the hell they are and they send one person to work. At 8am I finally get re-booked on a flight to Frankfurt. Of course I have to pay another 100 euros of train to Berlin from my own pocket. Cherry on top, they lose my luggage. At the gate the lady tells me that my luggage went on a different flight and she starts lying and saying that it\\'s because it will get faster to Frankfurt than me. 5 days have passed and still there are no signs of my luggage, which I probably won\\'t see anymore. I got home after almost 3 days of no sleep and extreme physical and mental distress. I\\'ve traveled a lot and this is by far the worst experience I\\'ve ever had. They treat people like garbage and don\\'t take any responsibility for the awful experience they\\'re putting you through. it\\'s absolutely unacceptable and I sincerely hope they shut down and burn. I will never flight again with this company ever again, even if they paid me a million dollars. \\xa0 \\xa0Flight delayed in Flagstaff to Phoenix, decided to drive 2 hrs to Phoenix to catch my connected fight to Portland thinking I would get a refund for unused flight. American Airlines told me to pound sand not their problem. I will never fly American again, I will pay more for another airline next time.  Airline charges to check bags, so I packed accordingly to avoid the ridiculous fee. When getting on the plane I was required to check my bag. There was plenty of space in the over head bins, and it was an unnecessary trouble. The gate agent was also extremely rude. I hate this airline.   So me, my fiancé and daughter went to Dallas for a wedding. I\\'m flying back alone and she asked if I would take the carry on. So when I get to the gate I was going to ask to get a first class ticket and said I don\\'t care right now I\\'ll pay. She clicks a little on the key board and says there is no available seats so I believe her why wouldn\\'t I. Now we\\'re getting ready to leave and they pull 2 customers to the front. I said excuse me, I asked if those were available and was told they weren\\'t.  Thank you for judging me and not letting buy a first class ticket. My son lives in another state and I usually use another airline and I will make sure to continue to do so.   To say I am disappointed in American Airlines is nothing but an understatement. My mom flew into the U.S from the U.K through Dublin on 6/17/24, 2 days ago and got all but two of the 6 bags she checked in at Heathrow. Upon her arrival here at DFW airport, she had to wait for 4 extra hours after traveling for over 8 hrs at the airport for her bags and she did not get them. We have since gotten a myriad of excuses from the incompetent staff members that have attended to us in person and over the phone to resolve this issue. We are totally displeased with the poor and extremely terrible service of a supervisor at the A.A desk at terminal A28 at the DFW airport. She gave us wrong bag tag numbers and lied that we will get the bags next day. Its over 48 hrs now and we have been given new tag numbers, we have been told the bags will arrive today the 19th, that the bags are in the Uk, that they are in dublin, that there is no details on them. Just a bunch of stupid, unimaginable and imbecilic excuses that makes no sense to a sane mind. This is the most excruciating experience I have had with any airline in my 40 yrs of life and I am beyond disappointed with American Airlines.   American Airlines is by far the worst experience (now the third time for us). Last night was the SECOND time we have been delayed at Charlotte airport with American Airlines because of not having an available crew to even fly the plane. Third time they have lost our luggage and by the far the worst customer service we have ever experienced in our lives. Literally. I have tried to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge in luggage and I was told “we don’t have anyone in charge of us”, twice. But yet another department claimed they do have supervisors to speak to. I have reached out to customer relations via online and only getting general letters back thanking us for feedback and can’t wait for us to fly with them again (if they were really reading my communication with them they would know this is by far accurate). I was told I could send a physical letter via mail because it’s impossible to speak to someone in customer relations. But this invisible help is supposed to be who helps their customers during a crisis?! Please share and get the word out! This is absolutely ridiculous.   I have been flying American Airlines for over 20 years now since living in the Dallas area and they are based here, there is usually plenty of options for flying times. My most recent trip from Denver to Dallas was nothing short of a nightmare. The flight was scheduled to leave at 2:30 and after several delays, the flight did not leave until after 11:00 pm. I walked into my house exhausted at 3:00 CST. I was a couple of minutes late at the gate for the final flight back, and the supervisor was not going to let me on the plane. Thank goodness a nice gate agent was able to get me on. I had my daughter with me on the same trip and I had to get her back early to South Carolina. What turned out to be an original flight cost of $200 ended up being close to $800. I will go out of my way, even if the time is inconvenient, to use other airlines in the future to avoid using American.   I contracted Covid and tried to get a refund for my flight. They said I wasn\\'t eligible, which is very frustrating because I did the right thing. My flight was day 8 of my 10 day quarantine and I wasn\\'t symptomatic by day 5. Having covid seems like perfectly reasonable grounds for a refund. I will avoid American whenever I can in the future.  Just know that even if you book months in advance you are only buying the opportunity to fly stand by. I attempted to print out a boarding pass after checking in and their app said that could not give be a boarding pass via the app and that I should go to the ticket counter, at least 200 people in line. I finally got my pass but could not run fast enough to make the flight. I am 72. I am now sitting for 4 hours for the next flight that I may or may not get a seat in. I am feeling abused.   This was the worst experience trip I had with American airlines. First of all the flight was canceled and was not informed about and then once got to Detroit they lost my luggage. I will probably not fly this airline again.   Worst airline in the world, my trip to Cancun been canceled four times, with more than 36 hours of waiting in the airport, and I have to wait in a line for four hours each time just to rebook a ticket which then get canceled. Also their hotels were full so I had to book a hotel in my own and I’m in my honeymoon they ruined it to me and also they didn’t refund me and they did nothing. They have the worst management in the airport and most of the staff are rude too - I will never come to this airline again my flight been canceled four times and my Cancun hotel were canceled and no one want to take the blame and no one refunds me.  I gave American one last chance and it brought back so many bad memories. Old decrepit plane broke down and delayed my flight and I may even miss my connection. Over 2 hours in a hot cabin with no A/C while they try to fix the plane that should have been retired last century. I am done, never will I fly with American Airlines. Not even in this trying times can this Airline get it right. So many bad memories, worst full price airline.   I loved traveling with American Airlines. They went out of their way to help me and was just a pleasant time. I will recommend American Airlines because they helped me accommodate my daughter and waited for me at the gate when I was running so fast to get there. Definitely recommend.  10 years ago they were a different airline, nothing amazing but better than expected for the price. Now you literally can\\'t fly with them. In 3 years, 4 AA flights, 4 issues. This last trip was from Nashville to Dallas was insanity. Got rerouted to Tulsa, spent 1.5 hours circling, 4 hours on the tarmac, got a water and bag of pretzels and was told the airport didn\\'t have to do that and to thank them. About the only information we ever got. AA let us off the plane at 9.10 when all the stores closed at 9. I didn\\'t want a handout, but let me off the plane so I can feed myself but almost exactly 8 hours to get from Nashville to a gate in Tulsa. Get to Dallas about 3 hours later, then 22.5 hours til new flight, have to get a hotel and no luggage. AA didn\\'t know where our luggage was but promises it will be at destination. Glad they checked my carry-on that had my medications, so beyond inconvenient. Glad I\\'m not on anything more life threatening. Desk told me I would have to wait until SD, go to the ER or he could call 911 for me. $500 unexpected later on a plane to SD, landing and pull up and over water, circle, pass, circle. I live in SD I know we\\'re doing weird stuff, I know the cities below us that keep coming and going. 3 circle and they finally announce we were too close to airline in front of us and had to get back in line. Over SD County til landing took 1h15m. This doesn\\'t happen with other airlines, Spirit is the 2nd worst and I\\'ll still buy a ticket from them, but never again AA.  First of all - social distance is not a thing on this airline. Tons of guests not wearing their masks correctly and no one is enforcing that. Flight attendants seem moody and angry to be there. The AA app is a glitchy mess, internet package was a joke, in-flight entertainment app/streaming service cuts out frequently. Then, as far as flight itself goes, I get a text message at 3.30amthat my first flight home (10/24 Flagstaff to Phoenix, then Phoenix to Orlando) was delayed by 40 minutes and that it \"may\" cause me to miss my connecting flight in Phoenix - it was cutting it close but after calling the airport in Phoenix to get advice, I decided to stick with the original flight. Found out after I arrived at the Flagstaff airport that the reason the flight was delayed is because they didn\\'t have a crew to fly the plane. The gate attendant announces less than an hour before our new departure time that they still had not found a crew to fly it and the plane was still in Phoenix. Why would they not just cancel the flight? Sure enough, now the flight was delayed by almost 2 hours, and there was no way I was going to make my connecting flight in Phoenix so I asked the flight attendant at the gate to change my flight to the morning. He did and I left. I attempted to check in on the app for my flight in the morning and upgrade my seat to an aisle, it processed a $61.82 payment twice but kept loading an error message saying that \"seat selection is unavailable at this time.\" After discovering that the payments were already showing up in my bank account, I called American Airlines to tell them I had been charged twice for a seat I still didn\\'t have a reservation for, and could they please change my seat. The woman on the phone said that something hadn\\'t been transferred correctly at the Flagstaff airport so that it showed me as having left on the original flights. She also said they didn\\'t have a record of the two $61.82 payments and that because I had already checked in, they couldn\\'t change my seat and I would have to wait until I go to the airport tomorrow to do it. She \"thinks\" the charges will be refunded. I will never, never, never fly with American Airlines again.   American failed to have a pilot ready for our flight, delaying the flight overnight literally as we started to board. Could not service us hotel or food vouchers at the gate because of \"technical difficulties\" but it appeared to be more employee incompetence. Further proof of that incompetence; their customer service counter told me I could claim diapers and wipes at the same counter I could claim a car seat, on the other side of Sky Harbor and down a level, just for me to find out that that was not true and no such supplies would be made available to me. The employees only suggestion was that I go out and get my own and request reimbursement. I am left stranded in a city hundreds of miles from home with none of my belongings and no way to acquire basic hygiene supplies for my infant without going out into the city on my own dime at 10 o\\'clock at night with an exhausted toddler in tow. The absolute worst fight experience I have ever had. The first and last time I will fly American, and I will tell all who will listen to stay away as well. Their pathetic offering of a food voucher included $12 a person and did not include my child. $48 dollars to feed a family of 5 for their own incompetence. Absolutely pathetic from start to finish. Stay away.  Pathetic service. My flight was part of a connection and the last leg. It was cancelled without a reason and I was forced into accepting a later flight which increased my 36hr journey to almost 38hrs. They were rude when asked if they can put me on an earlier flight and didn\\'t really care about the passengers.  I purchased tickets two weeks ago. Today I checked in and got two seats: 12b and 10a. I\\'m traveling with my wife. Why should I worry about switching seats with somebody who doesn\\'t want it? American Airlines is the worst company in the world.   Coming back from Greece after a 4 hour trip to London and a 7 plus hour trip from London to JFK I was scheduled to take a 12:59 PM flight to Pittsburgh, PA. After delaying the flight a couple times, we loaded and departed the gate and sat on the runway for over 2 1/2 hours before bring us back to the gate and leaving the plane. We kept getting delays until they finally cancelled the flight at 7:20 PM. I approached an American Airlines employee and asked her for a hotel voucher. She accused me of \"coming at her\". I tried unsuccessfully to get a rental car and there was no help anywhere to find a room close by. My son and daughter in law finally found me a room at a less than desirable hotel at $542/night. I had a friend of mine drive all the way to Brooklyn on Sunday morning and drive me home. I expressed all this in a complaint to American Airlines and gave them receipts. After 2 weeks they finally got back to me and told me they they referred the complaint to British Airways with whom I made the reservations to Greece and back. The bottom line here is that American Airlines staff were rude as hell and I couldn\\'t find anyone there who could care less. I will never fly AA again. This is without a doubt the worst airlines in the business.   I am going to be writing American Airlines about my last two travel experiences. They have been pretty awful. Between delays, Very little customer service, Lack of addressing issues proactively or after the fact. The single most rude and nasty gate agent at DFW.  And yes, I know to be nice to gate agents, they have a lot of discretion as to how much they can do to help you or not. She was in a bad mood when I got there, wouldn\\'t answer my question OR help, and was hateful in the process. Worst experience than the total waste of time today and yesterday. I was out my non refundable hotel room in Tucson last night, 2 meals out and 2 days of a lot of waiting and anxiety about getting home or not. Changing plans. Trying to get things taken care of. I am going to be contacting American directly, but was told by a couple of gate agents, that they respond more to social media posts than emails or letters.  I want my hotel from last night reimbursed, meal vouchers for the meals that I had past last night when I should have gotten home. And I want miles.  Southwest gave a $100 voucher for a 3 hour delay. I got home 26 hours after I should have.   Our family’s flight to AA1209 to Miami has been suddenly cancelled today 6/26 with no notice. Our final destination is St. John\\'s USVI. We have a connecting flight from MIA to St Thomas AA943. We had booked a taxi to pick us at St. Thomas at 2.30 pm to take us to the ferry on Sunday 6/27. We had paid the ferry tickets online as well. Then our rental car was awaiting for us at the ferry area which has been paid for as well. Also we booked a VRBO house. We no way of contacting anyone in your airline. We have called and left all numbers and wait for a call for 4+ hrs. What is this? We need to get to St. Thomas tomorrow or cancel our trip completely and we are not sure we will get a refund. It took a lot of time and effort and logistics to plan their trip and a couple years of savings to bring my grandkids with me. This is very irresponsible on your part to cancel all of the sudden and not even have the decency of calling the passengers is to try to find an alternative. We paid for tickets, taxis, ferry\\'s, cars, house and we want to support the economy during these hard times. I am not sure I can repeat this trip again next year as they are going to be in school. My dad is 70 years old and made this trip for 12+ years in the past but now he does not know he can make it again. This is terrible and disappointing.   Save yourself the massive headache and choose a different airline, even if it means paying slightly more. Constant delays and the staff openly lies to customers to de-escalate mounting frustrations. My first flight was from Dallas- Fort Worth International to Charlotte Douglas International. With a nearly full plane, we were stranded on the tarmac for over an hour because of a “last minute change” with the pilot, leaving us without a captain for the trip. The issue was eventually remedied by convincing an inbound pilot to fly our trip immediately following his own. This caused a significant number of passengers to miss connecting flights in Charlotte. I had a two hour layover before my last leg to Raleigh Durham International. Yet again, waiting at the gate for over an hour because the plane was late for arrival. The announcement for the delay came well after the plane was initially supposed to start boarding and customers were simply kept in the dark. Upon my return flight home back to Dallas, I was lucky enough to get a direct flight. And for a third time, the plane is delayed for “minor maintenance issues” but the announcement yet again came 20 mins after the flight was staged to board. All in all, I was an hour and a half late for return to my destination. I am a very understanding person and realize that unforeseen circumstances occasionally arise which may cause a delay to travel plans. I expect these things to happen and plan accordingly. However, these occurrences should be rare. A 20% delay rating is completely unacceptable for a major airline. They no longer care about customer satisfaction and pad your travel plans with a few extra hours of inconvenience if you do happen to choose this airline. No longer a reputable airline and won’t waste my money again.   As someone who travels frequently, this was the first time I encountered a staff that didn\\'t know how to smile or appear willing to help. This issue was not limited to a single staff member; the next desk had the same attitude. Since this was a work trip, my colleagues also had the same impression about the whole crew. It\\'s not just about their lack of willingness to work; it\\'s also the attitude that made me feel like I was doing something wrong or that I was an unvalued person who didn\\'t deserve good service. I was not going to write a review but they forced me to do this with things that happened afterward. My bag has not arrived with me. Their staff assured me that my bag would be sent directly to Porto. Trusting their words, I didn\\'t even think about tracking my bag during my 5-hour layover in Lisbon. Why would I? I have learned that my baggage was not even checked into Lisbon airport. Consequently, when I arrived in Porto, I had to wait a long time for my bag. I notified the lost bag department and missed my paid train home. I was exhausted and disappointed, not knowing what to do without my presentation materials. They called me whoever I was talking to (Stacey) was the only good thing about this airline. She was nice. I spent around 60 euros because of them. (paid ticket, presentation materials, clothes etc.) However, the other airline companies I know generally pay compensation right away. Here, they are asking you to fill out a form to claim your money.  It is well designed for you to give up and not be able to fill out the form to claim your money. In any way, the time I lost, the frustration I had for a couple of days. These were all enough for me to never ever use this company. This was my first experience with American Airlines, and I am sorry that it turned out this way.   I do not recommend flying American Airlines! Every seat was booked. No social distancing! Not clean. Didn’t feel safe. Due to the weather conditions our flight was canceled from HH. Once American canceled the flight the staff didn’t know how to help a plane full of stranded customers. Not enough American flights out of Savannah, Charlotte or Charleston. If you were lucky to get a flight get here we’re NO seats available. We walked away from the counter with NO flight to get home. Stranded! In order to get to Chicago O’Hare. We had to book a new flight on Delta for $1,012.00 and rent another vehicle to fly out of Savannah. I received an email 20 hours later saying they booked us a flight leaving tomorrow. Thursday! Awful experience. I recommend flying DELTA. They practice COVID-19 safety! No one sitting next to you. And they gave out complimentary water and snacks. Very Friendly too. They care about their passengers.  Delayed flights made me miss my connecting. I was talked into switching my final destination to an airport they claimed was 20 minutes away with a shuttle that could take me there for only $10. This was very untrue. It took me over 4 hours to get to my actual destination and close to $100. They would not give future credit, any type of refund or pay for the additional cost I had to pay to get to my destination. Not to mention they have no social distancing and their staff were rude.   The personnel at K16 gate working flight AA1200 around 11:45 am were extremely unprofessional and selective on who to harass. One of the ladies in her ignorant wisdom decided that my backpack, which standing next to a carry on is smaller, was too big. She made me waste time. I feel she took out her frustration of a full flight on me. Her assessment was unfounded.   This would’ve been my first time flying, unfortunately due to COVID-19 things changed. I have no other intention on flying and they won’t give a refund or let me give the ticket to anyone else! That is stealing, I’ll never fly or recommend anyone to fly with them. This virus effected everyone and to not be accommodated by this company just shows they don’t care about consumers.   I have been delayed since 8pm Friday night. Sat on the runway for 6 hours the next day. Flown to DFW and arrived late and missed connecting flight. Put on 2 more flights (dfw to Austin) at midnight and then next flight (Austin to Nashville) at 8am. 2 days trying to get home and they said they can not put us in a hotel because flight was delayed due to weather.  I will never fly again.  Plus American was only airline that had issue with our masks. I won\\'t get home till 2 days after my original flight and I have to sit with my kids in the airport 8 hrs for the next flight.   Seats bought and paid for on December 5, 2023 for Business Class, lie flat seats for out 50th anniversary splurge to Europe with confirmed seats. We were \"downgraded\" at the gate to allow other passengers to sit in our seats while we were pushed back to Premium economy with an offer of $600.00 flight credit. What in the world makes this ok? After trying to make contact with American Airlines, all I get are robot responses. American Airlines employees at the gate absolutely ruined our mindset for was to be a special trip. We arrived 5 hours early for this flight, checked in with TSA and were waiting in the lounge where my boarding pass was again scanned and reprinted with our assigned lie flat seats. Since my boarding pass had 3H, that is where I went and then asked an attendant what was happening. The guy sitting in my seat thought it was quite funny. I was sent back up the gate where I found my wife had been detained earlier and told to wait until the plane was boarded! Why were our seats given away? Who were our seats given to and why? American Airlines ruined our trip!  Seated instead against our wills Seats in row 14! I tried American airlines several times with not result other than canned \"thank you for submitting\" I am now trying Iberia and British Airways for a refund or full fare First Class to destination of our choice. By the way, all the other flights on this trip on actual Iberia planes was fantastic!   Our trip out of Sacramento CA on flight AA2078 started late due to weather from which our plane was arriving from, but I was told no problem we will make it. So delay turned positive, then! Mechanical problems and we had another delay, about 40 minutes, no problem we will make it and we did! Until, yes another issue, a plane was in our spot and we had another delay of 25 minutes and this caused us to miss our connector by 5 minutes and I was met with attitude at the desk telling us that the problem was weather related which was not true, when I called customer service they said you had mechanical difficulties and were treated to stand by, so yes they did get me off stand by the next day but no room offered plus I am a type one diabetic and I plan trips to be easy, will never trust American Airlines again with my vacation time and health problems when traveling again. There was so much shafting on their part to their paying customers how can anyone take this airline with trust. Never again American Airlines.   Second time I waited on the tarmac for more than 3 hours for the flight to eventually be cancelled. The first time this happened was several years ago (same situation). I missed my connection because of this and when I tried to get a new flight the only option would\\'ve gotten me to the airport after my cousin\\'s wedding was already over. Furthermore I\\'m out the money I spent on the hotel. American Airlines is a joke. They were so incompetent that Expedia had to request the refund for it to actually go through. Never flying with them again.   Do not fly American Airlines unless you are willing to have your flight changed. I booked a flight months in advance on a flight that only had one layover with less than two hours in between. I did this on purpose so as not to expose myself for long to crowds of people during this pandemic. American changed my flight weeks before I was to fly to having a 6 HOUR layover before my next flight! When I contacted the airline the only solution they could provide me was a double layover in multiple airports to \"break up\" the time of my flight. So instead of one stop with a six hour layover I would have two layovers with several hours before each flight took off. This was there way of \"helping\" to compensate me for their changes. What they did was change the size of plane I would be flying on. That was the whole reason for the extended layover. Do not fly with them. If you do be prepared to have your flight changed, or delayed. Nothing else was even offered to me for the changes. No upgrades. Not even access to the Lounges. This is not customer service. Now my day went from an 8 hour day of flying to a 15 hour day of flying.   I was flying from Kona, HI to Phoenix, AZ on 3-27-24 Flight AA60. I arrived at the Kona airport 2 hrs prior to my flight and stood in a very long line at the ticketing counter where one employee was working. I had already purchased my checked bag through the app so I thought about going to the counter and asking for my baggage tag but did not want to be disrespectful of all of the people in front of me, so I stood in the long line. By the time I got up to the counter, it was about 40 minutes to my flight, and I was denied the ability to check my bag. I assured the attendant that I was there in plenty of time, but that the line was long, and even asked that they check cameras to verify. I was told that he is not going to put my luggage onto this flight regardless of me being here on time because I didn’t make it to the counter in time. His only resolution was to rebook on a later flight and stated that I would have to buy a whole new ticket to even get on it. When I protested, the agent rolled his eyes, smirked, slammed my ID on the counter face down, and walked away while I was still speaking. I was with two friends and we were in utter shock of the disrespect displayed by the employee. I asked for a manager, but she refused to come over. I needed to make this flight so I could get home for work, so I had to leave my suitcase on HI. These agents laughed at me and told me “good luck”. Once I arrived home, I called American Airlines to report this, but was told by the representative and the supervisor to call American Airlines cargo to pay and have my suitcase shipped, because they would do nothing about this. Even though I protested because I thought this was outrageous, I called American Airlines cargo. AA Cargo stated “I don’t know why representatives continue to send customers to us… we will only work with businesses, not passengers for their personal luggage. I got off the phone with them and wondered why “the right hand doesn’t know what the left-hand is doing“ at American Airlines, and still sat with no resolve of getting my luggage from Hawaii to Phoenix. My only option was to email a complaint because American Airlines will not even take complaints by phone and attempt to help customers. I am an American Airlines advantage member and this represents American Airlines and Kona airport terribly as being absolutely no help and disrespectful to their patrons. And I am now back home without any of my belongings to no fault of my own with no resolution to this horrific experience offered by American Airlines except their own cargo company (that actually is not an option), and a suggestion to FedEx my 50 pound suitcase for nearly $400.00. Shame on you, American Airlines, for causing this issue in the first place, not accommodating a loyal customer, allowing disrespect to happen in multiple avenues of your company, blaming me for standing in your long line for too long, and offering no help or resolution to someone who is now out all of their personal belongings all because you did not schedule enough employees at the ticketing counter to work through long lines, and allowed blatant, disrespect, and disregard for customers. Shame on you. With all of the other airline options out there, and many being cheaper than American Airlines, I will not be flying American Airlines anytime soon, and I do not suggest you do, either.  American gave away aircraft twice and now no pilot! Incremental delays keep you chasing updates and gate changes. We are 4 hours in and still no hope. Spending 24 hrs to cross country. They will blame weather but they are giving aircraft to other routes. Most worthless customer service ever. Chatbot will provide platitudes   American cares nothing about doing the right thing in regards to its passengers. Had a flight out of Durango, CO. I checked in and paid my baggage fees online the day before my flight to save time. The morning of my flight there was a snowstorm. Several passengers were late in checking in due to traffic from the storm. American Refused to take our checked luggage saying we had missed the cut off for checking bags. I missed it by 15 min. I had to leave my luggage behind with family members and get on my flight. Other passengers who checked in after me brought their luggage into the plane with them. They were told their bags were too big and would need to be valet checked. So because I listened to the ticket agent and followed what she told me, I had to leave my bag behind and have it shipped to me for $50. I should have ignored her and just proceeded to the plane with my bag and had it valet checked. Also I was at Durango airport not Dallas Fort Worth. They had plenty of time to get our bags on that flight. Now I’ve requested a refund for the $30 checked baggage fee because American refused to take my checked bags. Of course my refund was denied. In the end I’ve learned an expensive lesson. Do not pay baggage fees until you hand American Airlines your bags. I paid for a service through American Airlines that I did not receive. It’s all about the almighty dollar, as usual.   I\\'ve heard horror stories from American airlines and after this weekend I believe every single one of them. Our trip started off in fort Lauderdale after vacationing in Florida for 10 days we were ready to get home. But when we arrived at the airport our flight was delayed 3 hours. They blamed it on weather and an unruly passenger. (Although I beg to differ, it\\'s because of vaccine mandates and over booking flights) but so when we landed in Charlotte our connecting flight to home to Portland, Oregon had already departed. We then stood in a line for 2.5 hours and were told out only option to leave there was to go to Texas and try and get a flight from there home the next day. So the following morning when we went to our gate in Texas to fly home we were told we were in the 20s on stand by. Only one stand by person got on that flight and so they rolled us to the next flight .. after 4 flights through put the day with no closer to getting on a flight, we tried to fly anywhere closer to the west. Just so we could drive home. But all flights were over booked and were told the only this to do was continue to wait for a stand by. We would have been there for a week if we stayed with American airlines. We eventually bought  new tickets on Alaska airlines at the next time we could and that was 3 days later. So we then had to get a hotel for 3 nights, food and clothes because American airlines decided to go ahead and ship our bags home, knowing full well we were not going to be on that flight. And off all the 15 plus American employees we encounter all were awfully rude and sucked at customer service. We were offered nothing and treated badly.   Arrived to the airport and it was absolutely chaos. Under staffed, broken kiosks, and lines so long I was unable to check in before the bag check closed. Employees looked overwhelmed. Completely unprofessional and disorganized. I\\'ve never seen anything like it at an airport before. Avoid at all costs.   Traveling American Airlines today has been an awful experience and still is. I boarded this morning at 7:30 AM and was supposed to arrive at 11:30 but did not arrive until 4:00PM. Was supposed to return to Philadelphia from Dallas the same day and was supposed to leave at 7PM and here it is 12:30AM and I am so waiting.   The customer service at the gate in Atlanta GA on flight AA 2591/02 going to Miami July 2nd around 1:00 was so horrible I don’t know how they have a job there. I have worked in customer service for 15 years and I have never in my life spoke to a customer in the manner this lady spoke to myself my husband and my two children. She was extremely rude and her comments were unnecessary. We were flying standby. Once boarding started, I walked to the counter to see if any standby tickets had been cleared. She said no. So I proceeded to step to the side and continue my phone call with Carnival cruise line to let them know we are arriving late. Not even 3 minutes later my family is calling my name for us to board. As we were gathering our belongings and walking up to the boarding gate she yells to me and my family, y’all moving pretty slow to be on standby, and says to me you was just up here asking if you were cleared but you taking your time. She made my 7 and 12 year old very uncomfortable when she made those remarks. It takes a lot to upset me but she pushed that button so quickly and doesn’t deserve her job with AA.   We had planned a few days of vacation in Mysti Connecticut, the initial flight was at 11 am from Raleigh NC to PA and at 1:30 the connection from PA to Connecticut would leave, but, unfortunately we never arrived at the destination, the plane in Raleigh was It took 1 hour, they didn\\'t give any reason for the delay, and when we got to the connection, the customer service girl said that she couldn\\'t do anything, that the only option was to travel another day. Really, disappointed with the bad service. Due to the poor quality of service, we lost money on tickets, on hotels, on renting a car, and the people at American Airlines don\\'t care if the customer misses the flights.   We experienced wonderful service by crew and ground staff. Onboard wifi and snacks. No delays. Departed on time. Though Santa Fe airport was small the staff gave the checked-in baggage as soon as possible. great value for money as well. Seat and legroom was comfortable too. Will definitely fly with them again! \\xa0\\xa0I was on flight 1036 and I happened to leave my sunglasses at security. Sandra and the other flight attendants were very helpful and the captain even attempted to get them back. Thanks for being so nice you got a customer for life  I flew from Miami to Los Angeles last week. My flight was a little bit complicated, and I couldn\\'t solve it. And then, I went to American Airlines customer service and wanted to talk with the supervisor. I asked one lady about the supervisor, and she asked me about my concern. I was a little hopeless, but she called somewhere, explained my situation patiently, maybe 2 -3 times, followed up on this issue, and solved my luggage and ticket problem. I really impressed by her dedication. I appreciate it.   I cannot believe what heartless people work here. The care and treatment of your customers is absolutely disgraceful, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves and how you do business. I have a flight credit that expired 2 days ago, and I\\'ve asked a supervisor for a small extension of time to figure out a new trip, as I did not know the credit had already expired. And I have been told NO. I\\'m not asking for my $500 back, just a simple extension of a few days time to figure out a new plan, since my first 2 trips with credit were canceled due to COVID. Something that was definitely beyond my control. How does a few days of time take away from your success? When it can absolutely make or break mine. How does nobody there care? I was told from the beginning not to book with American Airlines, and now I can see why. . I will always pay more to fly with Delta so I can be treated like a real human in this world.   Bad customer service. On October 18, I was flying from Norfolk, Virginia to Sacramento, California and I faced another bad experience with American Airlines. This is the second bad experience in the last two months. I was already in the airplane when the flight attendant announced that Charlotte airport had some water issues so my flight was delayed. It meant that I was missing my connecting flight. After few minutes, the flight attendant announced that at that point they did not know when the airplane will be departing so passengers started leaving the plane and tried to rebook their flights since the majority of the passengers were missing their connecting flight. When we returned to the airport, there was mess. American Airplanes agent was rude to all passengers, American Airlines did not have plan B for the situation. There was a chaos by the gate. American Airlines agents were not able to give clear message or clear updates. I started rebooking my flight - they refused to rebook the flight from Norfolk to Charlotte, they said that I needed to pay again for the flight or I could fly to Charlotte and spend a night at the airport or I could book the hotel at my own expense. I had no other option but fly to Charlotte and book the hotel and pay for the hotel on my own. Another thing, do not buy their internet, it doesn’t work most of the flight anyway. If you want to be treated like normal passenger, fly with another airlines.  Absolutely no social distancing. People on top of one another. Don’t do it! Very unsafe! People eating for long amounts of time. Some people with no mask. Nothing was enforced.   First of all there isn’t enough space to describe how bad I feel on this page. We booked this flight 5/6 weeks ago to Yellow stone national park. Rental car booked, hotels booked, baby sitter paid for and booked along with a dog sitter. And vacation hours used up. And 9 hours before wheels up we get a notification that our flight has been cancelled. Zero remorse from the caller who we reached out to and absolutely zero try from them to get us on a flight. I don’t know how AA is still in business with the absolute poor customer service. I would rather rent a car and drive to a destination than fly with this awful company. And on top of that we are expected to wait 7 days for a return on our money that they took immediately upon pushing the book button on their app. I truly hope someone sees this review and actually tries to do better. But knowing big business care very little about their customers I would think I’m wanting something that will never happen. For the love of God if someone is looking to fly somewhere do not book with AA! Let my experience save you a heartache.   I came back to US from Panama on flight 2192 on July 21st. The flight was delayed as usual. The flight attendants, except Keko, were not friendly at all. They were sitting on the last row, just behind me, playing with their phones while Keko was working all the time preparing the \"food and beverages\" for the passengers. While she was doing her job,  one of the flight attendants told her to stop working because she was doing too much! He did not even care that we, the reason for what he has a job were listening to him because we are not important anymore for the American employees. It\\'s unbelievable how disrespectful they were, pretending nobody could understand them. I always try to avoid American because of these attitudes that are present in almost every employee. It\\'s very disappointing to see the \"American\" Airline to treat their passengers, the people they are supposed to serve, like we are trash.  Dallas to Washington. I want to preface this review by saying that we are American Airlines members and pay monthly for this service. We had a flight booked for Washington that was going to connect with an international airline and fly to Istanbul then Italy. We checked our bags and got on the flight and sat on a plane that did not move for two hours, after this they came and told us that there was no pilot and we had to get off the flight and attempt to reschedule. The only option they gave us was a different connecting flight and we did not want to take it. After we declined we wanted to get our bags that we had checked and the man said that they are downstairs and that he’s not allowed to go down there and that the people downstairs were not answering the phone so we waited a couple more hours and ended up leaving after they wouldn’t give us our bags and said they would try to find a flight in the morning. Our bags ended up getting flown to Washington without us and initially they did not know where our bags went so we couldn’t go to Washington and get them and we lost our international tickets from the other airline with no refund, lost our rental car in Italy with no refund and had to buy new items like clothes to try and travel that weekend, and were not reimbursed for any of that. They also gave us Economy class ticket refunds when we bought business class so we lost money on the flight as well.   Always delayed. I haven\\'t traveled since covid and thought AA had changed. But here I sit in Denver waiting on yet another 2hr delay. They need to publish their failure rate. In fact all Airlines should publish their failure/success rate. Then they want to know value for money? If the tickets were free and you can\\'t get to you\\'re destination in a timely manner, you\\'re just wasting paper!   Worst airline. Not only do they not provide a glass of water, but they always complain about the size of carry-on. They take it away from me every time I fly. They keep saying the flight is full but I saw many other carry-ons bigger and they just don’t care. I have some medication I had to take with me and a blood pressure machine and they still took it away. They don’t treat customers well. June I flew twice with them and hope to be the last one.    We are loyal United customers and now I know why. Check in staff was not friendly. They made us check our carry on bags because they said they were full. When we got to our seats there were lots of open spaces for our bags in the overhead. If I wanted to check a bag I would have packed a bigger one. The flight was delayed and the bathrooms were not working. \\xa0 \\xa0I bought a 1st class round-trip ticket from Los Angeles to Raleigh, June 3, returning June 11th for a medical surgical trip to UNC with a wheelchair request. First leg was fine. Return trip though, it seemed that everything that could go wrong, did. At the American Airline departure counter in Raleigh, I checked in, and was told to wait for a wheelchair. 1 hour later, no wheelchair and with flight departure approaching, I forced myself to walk through TSA pre-check and to the gate. While walking to gate 25 departure gate, of course I walk past at least 2 wheelchair porters just casually walking somewhere, taking their sweet time. The flight service was ok (not good given 1st class). The food, we\\'re offered two choices. One exotic sounding, and another a dish with eggs and cheese.  I chose some fancy breakfast name which I had no idea what it was and I got served gammy prosciutto ham, with a large side of raw almonds. You can imagine how upset I became eating almonds after face and neck surgery. I asked for a softer disk but their was nothing else...only processed chips, which I could not chew anyway. The larger point; $1,500 roundrip ticket to be served a bag of almonds. This is the last time I fly 1st class on AA and will probably back away from only flying this airline alone.  We had a stop in Dallas. We was supposed to depart at 11:30pm CT. Then at 12am it got delayed until 8am the next morning. By the time I got through the line to get our hotel voucher it was 2am! And they was telling everyone to be back at the airport by 6am. So I was only going to get what 3 hours sleep. The best part is why it got delayed. Not covid! The flight attendant was at the wrong terminal. He showed up 15 mins after they canceled the flight. So I lost a night in Las Vegas because a flight attendant was basically lost in the airport. And they did nothing for us and I even talked to the supervisor. They have no sense of customer service at American Airlines. If it was health/covid related I could understand but this was complete incompetence and they took no responsibility. I also watched another customer wait for a car seat because she had a small child and they could not find it. So do you think they tried to find it? No told her sorry and they just left. Never will I fly with American Airlines again.   American Airlines used to be a great airline, I don’t know what happened to them, it’s getting worse and worse. Coming back from Cozumel to Dallas, on AA 1256 scheduled to depart at 7:02 but got delayed for 2 hours!. Anyway I arrive to airport without COVID test which is was my fault, but I had 5 hours to go back to the San Miguel and do my COVID test. The attendant knew that plane will get delayed for a long time because it hasn’t left Dallas yet , but they send me to the local COVID station and make me pay 70 bucks cash for each person, and if you don’t have cash you can’t get a test and if you can’t get a test you can’t get on the plane how funny.   I had the worst experience flying with American Airlines. The Customer Service Team was not helpful at all. My first flight was delayed (not because of weather) by 3.5 Hours at Austin Bergstrom Airport and I got to know when I was waiting at the gate to Board. I headed to the Customer Service Desk without any directions or signs. I approached the desk and there was a huge line. It was not organised at all and only two agents were available at the desk to assist. They were ruthless. They gave me fewer options and none of the options allowed me to reach the final destination on time. No compensation was provided. On the other hand, I arrived late and had to take 3 stops and 4 flights which was tiring and uncomfortable for me. The worst part I paid an extra $100 for an additional bag and both bags were damaged. Please find attached the pictures of the bags. I will never recommend anyone to fly with American Airlines.  Change of gates 2 hours before my flight. Made me miss my flight. When they sent me the email update I didn\\'t get it until 15 minutes before the flight because I was on another flight and landed at 8 pm. My flight left at 8.48 and got to the gate at 8.40 to realize they change the gate from A8 to C6! From one side of the airport to the other. Never flying American again.  I booked a flight from Asheville north Carolina to Fargo and this was cancelled 4 times. That\\'s four times my flight was cancelled. Every time i would pick a new flight it would get cancelled. I never even made it to my destination. whenever booking via Priceline, American is always the first and only airlines to show up as having the best deals, however i believe more could have been done for me in the way of getting me to my destination and AA didnt even try. I see a lot of greed and at the expense of others no matter what happens to a passenger.   Amsterdam to Quito via Dallas / Miami. The worst airline in the world, not only they advised me to book with them when I asked them if it was ok due to covid, to find out once I booked that I won’t be able to transit through the USA due to virus, so I was misled, I fortunately was able to cancel flight within their 24 hours policy cancelling, even after I was advised after another member of staff that I should think about it, I didn’t trust so I cancelled yet I was left waiting for over ten days to get my money back and only did so because I filed a complaint through my credit card company, I emailed their customer service to be lied on a daily basis that my money would be there, the next day. They’re a terrible company that makes you feel conned, even after it was one of their staff’s mistake, they have the worse customer service, I’ve ever encountered and then I was made to feel they were doing me a favor to return my money, without any compensation, costing me thousands of dollars as I now left my booking to last minute, why can’t they simply return the money straight away, it’s clear they make money off it. A very unhappy customer.   Go for whichever other alternative is available- it cannot get worse than this! After a 24-hour flight from India, I was supposed to fly out of Chicago at 12:30 pm. The flight was delayed multiple times until they finally started boarding at around 3:30 pm. After all the passengers had boarded the flight, there was another hour and a half of delay due to the excessive weight on the airplane. After finally reaching Indianapolis, my luggage was missing. I had to go looking for American Airlines officials for a while only to be greeted by a rude official who informed me that my luggage would be arriving by the next flight. Sleep-deprived and jet-lagged, I swear I am never choosing American Airlines again!   I regret to say that my recent experience with American Airlines was incredibly disappointing. My journey on October 26, 2023, was plagued by significant flight delays and a complete lack of communication regarding my connecting flight in Dallas. I had to initiate multiple calls to their customer service department, but the responses were marked by incompetence and indifference. The reasons given for the delays ranged from crew no-shows to inaccurate weather-related explanations, and I even had a representative hang up on me when I inquired about alternative flight options. As a result, I had to take matters into my own hands to secure an alternative flight, causing me to miss dinner reservations and a significant portion of my vacation plans. This is unacceptable and does not align with the level of service I expected. The return journey on October 30, 2023, was no better, with unexplained delays during my layover in Dallas leading to further disruptions. Customer service on October 31 was dismissive and offered no compensation, insisting that the airline fulfilled its duty merely by getting me to my destination \"without harm or injury.\" The entire experience left me disillusioned. American Airlines displayed a shocking lack of coordination, communication, and accountability. It\\'s vital that they acknowledge their responsibility in these matters. I expect a thorough investigation and fair compensation for the disruptions I experienced. I strongly urge American Airlines to improve their customer service, communication, and accountability to prevent others from enduring similar ordeals. It is my hope that they will take prompt action to address these issues and restore customer trust. I await their response, hoping for a more positive outcome and a resolution to these issues.  If you value your health and your peace of mind, please do not fly this airline. My round trip had 4 legs and each leg was packed with people - at the gate, boarding, in the seats, deplaning. Several people were not wearing masks while boarding. There was absolutely no social distancing. In contrast, I recently flew on Delta which was a completely different experience and I felt completely safe because they had all middle seats empty and encouraged social distancing by loading the back of the plane first and then moved forward. Deplaning was done one row at a time from the front to the back. American was the opposite. They board the front first which makes no sense. They also allow everyone to rise at once to deplane. I will never fly this airline again and I encourage everyone to avoid it at all costs.   I would like to complain about the Customer Relations department which is the only department that customers can only write in to address issues and concerns via email. They never replied until I went through a reservation department yesterday. The supervisor of the reservation department was very nice and took an effort to bring forward my questions and concerns to the department. This morning at 8 am I received a voice call from the Customer Relations Department from a lady who claimed she is the executive administrator of the department. She elected not to align with my views and queries. I respected her decision. However, I told her what a lousy service her department has been provided and not the American Airlines that I used to like and know. She immediately changed her voice and tone toward hostility of my view. I told her I wrote four emails for more than 2 weeks and never get any replies from the department. I expressed that we as the Customers have no way to call and address issues and concerns to the executive branch of her department. She argued all emails were read by the executive branch. If this is the case, the four emails that I wrote should have been gotten a reply. She said that was the reason she called this morning. I told her she called not until I escalated my questions to the reservation department threatened to bring them forward to the CEO or go public to put in a review. I hope this email is read by the CEO and take the immediate investigation into the services provided by this Customer Relation department, especially to this lady who called me this morning. It was a horrible conversation. When this so-called executive administrator called this morning was not friendly and rude and could not take criticism. Her voice and tone turned hostile immediately once I expressed my view of bad services provided by the department. I have been a loyal customer and am able to achieve the highest elite status each year.  An all-time new low from American Airlines domestic. How dare they get away with calling this joke of a service First Class? Of course First Class was packed with all the AAdvantage upgrades. In reality, the ONLY thing you get in American domestic First Class is a slightly wider seat. The service from the stewardess was non-existent. She did the bare minimum and then disappeared into the galley for the entire flight. I would not have believed earlier reviews about the new B737-800 MAX if I hadn\\'t experienced it myself for the first time. The seats, even in First Class, are extraordinarily uncomfortable, even for a mere four hour flight. Also, there is no seat-back entertainment screen whatsoever. Presumably, this is some ploy to force passengers to pay for the very poor WIFI. I cannot stress enough how awful American Airlines truly is. Do not waste your hard earned money or points flying this airlines, unless you absolutely are forced to do so.   Today marks the third time I have flown with American Airlines and it also marks the third time my flights have been delayed/my connecting flight has been missed due to Flight Crew tardiness. Prices for tickets through American are good but they have not been dependable or reliable for me at all.   The check in at a OHare was great, the gentleman that assisted us were friendly and helpful. The wait was fine but upon loading the airplane we noticed that the hostesses were unhappy. They were rude during our flight, snotty even. The captain updated every one constantly which was appreciated and the actual flight was smooth. I have never flown with a group of more unhappy flight attendants. We will not ever board another American Airlines flight. The attendants did not greet anyone as they entered or acknowledged anyone as they exited. There was not a smile among the entire group for the entire flight.  A 1:30 hour flight that was meant to depart at 2:30 led me to waste my whole day because of some mismanagement. They delayed the flight several times beforehand eventually cancelling it later on there was no proper communication to the customers and absolute ignorance towards us. Also they didn’t provide us any compensation as we were delayed for over 5 hours eventually cancelling the flight. Worst experience ever will not recommend to anyone literally wasted my whole day cause of their mismanagement. They booked us for next day at the same time, my mom is in a wheelchair and the flight was delayed 5 hours. Nobody could help me to look for a place for her to rest. They don\\'t care about people. They only want our money and because of them, my mom was not able to attend a very important appointment.   Please choose another airline! I\\'ll never fly with this airline again. Our flight from New Orleans was initially delayed for 20 mins which was not a big deal. 2 hours later we were still on the ground. It took us 4 hours total to get to Dallas from Nola. Alright, mistakes happen. Our next flight was supposed to leave 2 hours later, but they kept changing departure time 5 times until they finally canceled it at 7pm and nothing is available until July 5th. Happy vacation!   Flew from Nashville to Quito with an hour stop in Miami in late July 2022. Flight to Miami was fine, apart from the ludicrous check in system that took about an hour longer than it needed to. Once we got into Miami we found our next flight been delayed about an hour. No worries, even multiple hour delays are expected sometimes, I can deal with that. But from there it got ridiculous. Boarded the plane in Miami, sat on the tarmac for two hours with no refreshments while the cabin crew made up excuses. First it was technical issues, then a shortage of crew members, then finally no pilot. We were asked to exit the plane but assured it would be a short delay. Once we were off the plane they cancelled the flight and told us to get into line for rebooking. The rebooking line took 9 HOURS for us, but as more and more flights were cancelled, people were standing in line for up to 15 hours! When we finally reached the front of the queue we were told that the flight was cancelled due to weather, despite being told that there was no captain, and witnessing a multitude of other flights taking off and landing during this \\'weather\\'. Because of this blatant lie of a cancellation reason we were entitled to nothing but a seat on the next flight out (for us 24 hours later). We wanted to fly back to Nashville that night with a refund so we could rebook with a competent airline, but we told ‘you can’t because it was cancelled due to weather’. No hotel vouchers, no food vouchers and even the free water bottles and single cookies had run out 5 hours prior. Not even an apology. There was a group behind us flying somewhere else that would miss a funeral if they couldn\\'t leave the following morning and were just told \\'too bad\\'. We were forced to sleep on the filthy floor of Miami Airport in 20 degrees C (68 F) aircon all night. Finally we made it to Quito where of course I discovered that they had lost my backpack. It has now been two days with no updates and I am stuck in 5 degrees C (41 F) weather with nothing but a thin jumper and shorts, on my honeymoon. This airline actively hates it\\'s customers and will never lift a finger to help you, despite receiving billions of your taxes in bailouts over covid. I will never fly with them again and you should avoid them like the plague. Absolute joke.  Flight cancelled and delayed multiple times, shifted connecting flight to 5 days later! My flight from PDX to DFW on Sunday was cancelled with an excuse of bad weather. I had connecting international flight and visa interview scheduled in my home country. When enquired, I got to know other airlines were running their flights in the same time frame. I was rescheduled two days later Tuesday. My flight was at 2.00 pm. They cancelled the flight and rebooked me to an earlier flight 12.00 pm. But that flight was also delayed 1 by 1 hour and scheduled at 4.45 pm at last. I would miss my international flight and wanted to cancel the flight. But they said they can\\'t return the check in bags now and I have to wait to get the check in bags in courier if I cancel. In that case I can\\'t take flight from other airlines even. Then they said they will rebook my international flight oj the next day and hurrily pushed me to take the delayed flight. When I reached DFW, I got to know that they rescheduled me for a flight two days later! This is a total disaster for my international travel. I lost 1 week of my 3 weeks vacation here.   American Airlines is the worst airline to fly on, this is my 4th flight where something is wrong with the plane so I’m delayed on what I need to do. This has happened more than a few times. Definitely wouldn’t recommend.   La Guardia to Charlotte. Worst service ever! The stuff are rude, careless, and they might lie just to put you in troubles! Beware not to fly with American Airlines .  Terrible Service! The most hypocritical airline by far. The plane is full and middle seats are packed. You are forced to wear a mask to “protect yourself” and yet there is no beverage service and no water?  American will make their money but filling the cabins, who cares about social distancing, but we care for your safety by not serving beverages. Fly Delta. They at least are serving water and a snack bag.  Flight delayed by 2 hours and once we boarded, the plane was not cleaned from the flight before. The previous passengers dirty tissue was in my backseat storage and when I used a disinfectant wipe to clean my seat’s arm rests and my tray table, the wipe was almost black from how dirty it was. The service was terrible and the crew was very off putting and rude to everyone. There was very little leg room compared to other airlines, and there was limited inflight entertainment options by comparison, Delta has live TV and over 1,000 TV shows and Movies to watch for free, and they provide you with earbuds. Flying with American Airlines is the dumbest thing a human being could ever possibly do.  American Airlines really dropped the ball here. My flight was scheduled to leave at 5.32 from terminal 2 C11. I received a text notification that there were delays, which was fine. However, I stopped receiving notifications and there were no updates online so I continued to stay in the area of C11. There was another flight leaving from that gate so I spoke to the attendants, who scanned my boarding pass and told me the plane was on route and should be there around 8, then they left and there was no one else around to talk to. At about 9.30 I checked online again and it said that the flight was on time leaving at 9.04 from C21. I found a phone that connected to the airport\\'s customer service, and the woman actually laughed as she told me the flight had already left and I\\'d need to contact American Airlines customer service but I wouldn\\'t have any luck at that time of night, so try in the morning. I received no notification of gate change, there were no announcements of final boarding call. I was checked in and they had scanned my boarding pass! They can give me that money back, but they can\\'t give me the five hours I sat there waiting, or the experience of my sister\\'s first baby shower or the weekend we had planned together. I will never book with American Airlines again!   Houston to Buffalo via Chicago. American Airlines is the worst airline. flight AA3683 canceled due to weather. I get it, it happens. I go to service desk and they had rebooked me for the next morning. I asked to be moved to United flight that night. Guy says it is full. I walk away and start booking United flight on line. I have a choice of 30 seats. I get back in line for AA service counter, and now girl is saying United blocked AA from booking flight as the next girl over is telling another customer she could book them on United, but if United flight gets canceled they can’t come back to AA. Lie after lie after lie. I get to the United counter and guy says flight is wide open and they didn’t block AA. He said AA would have to pay full fare if they moved me. I’m cutting up my AA credit card and discarding my miles I have they are just not worth it.   American has an awards program that is just a shame. After spending tens of thousands of dollars on flights, my status is now Gold from Platinum Pro. They wanted thousands of more dollars to “secure” my status after flying probably 30 times last year. Just frustrating. Now I have to pay for better seats and I’m Group 4. You have to travel international or travel and do multi-city connections to do anything here. I have a family ... I need to switch.   I have never experienced such horrible service and do not want others to experience what I did at American Airlines. They messed up my name on my ticket (putting my middle initial as my last name?) and when I contacted them to get it fixed I had to be on hold for 14 hours. They called back at 3:28 in the morning, of course, I wasn\\'t awake then I had to wait on hold for another 6 hours, which is crazy, within 24 hours of my flight because I was trying to check-in. So they charged me to \"fix\" my name which was their mistake and said I must get to the airport early. So I had to leave work (pay) early. Then, on the trip back, their site would not let me or my friend check in. So I had to get to the airport early again and they charged me, again, to be able to board the flight. I called after this entire situation and after 16 different transfers over the span of two weeks I was finally made aware of their customer relations line. The customer relations line offers no customer relations. I was told to email them, which I did, but you\\'re automatically directed to submit through this form, therefore your original email never existed, you do that and they get back to you any range from two weeks (me) or two months (me again). The person you work with sends you an email saying \"respond directly back to this email\" and then it directs you back to the form to start the entire process over. Overall, if you want to save yourself time, money, even more money and overall stress do not book with American Airlines. I have never dealt with these issues. I also did not receive any service or compensation for the problems this airline caused because even though they made a huge mistake, of course they did not want to acknowledge it, and therefore place blame on anyone but themselves-even the customer. I showed documents and proof galore, it was all on American Airlines company site, yet then they tried and tell me that I was never on their site and never spoke with them. How the heck did I book the flight and eventually (after being charged numerous times) get on the flight if I never went on the site or spoke with them? I am honestly still in a state of shock to see how this airline treats their clients. This was my first and last time flying them, they need to do something about their mistakes. I still cannot believe how much they messed up and took from me. A company like this honestly should not be operating, I do not want this to happen to anyone else. Wish I read reviews beforehand because they\\'re already struggling.  Worst Customer service ever 1.departing flight. Pilot rejected plane because inside temp of plane was 109 (his words). Plane was sitting and AA forgot to use the aux power to support the planes ac Resulting in hours delay because of AA employee mistake. NOT WEATHER OR MECHANICAL. Asked AA for some points but got nothing 2. Return flight paid for 2 first class tickets (a upgrade for us and our vacation) and had to fly in coach. Not a big deal but I paid for the first class tickets took multiple email and phone calls finally got reimbursed for a partially $150. The ticket upgrade was $400 each when I booked What a bunch of trash. I’m disputing my charge on my AA credit card and will be closing out account USE ANOTHER AIRLINE if you care about customer service   This was going to be my first time flying with American Airlines. I had a vacation package booked for this weekend to Mexico flying out of MIAMI for my husband surprise birthday . All exclusive Resort (which I was told AA was the best for these types of packages) All excited to go however the day before we leave an unexpected change (set back) happened therefore were unable to go. Thursday 5/20/21 my travel agent has been trying to get threw to anyone within Customer service as soon as she does 7 hours later and that\\'s waiting on the call back the phone was disconnected nobody from AA had the curstey to call her back the professionalism was gone once that happened. Moving forward to 5/21/21 at 7:30am let\\'s try again but this time we need management to be involved left a couple of VOICE MAILS and as of now still have not received a call back nor an email. (5/22/2021 1:30am ) still waiting. The disappointment and sadness I feel as a new customer words can\\'t explain. What hurts the most is the poor customer service that could\\'ve been corrected once the phone was disconnected. Now that no one has called my agent back makes me feel like my hard earn money and the excitement I wanted to see my husband have has gone Down the drain. The thing about this is I don\\'t want the money back we just needed a voucher so we can rebook Within a couple of weeks. So now instead of my husband enjoying his Birthday he has to watch me sit and worry if anything will happen if we\\'ll receive a call back. My fear is next week comes and AA says oh sorry there\\'s nothing we can do it\\'s to late but we\\'ve been trying since Thursday. I truly do understand that people are busy but for a well known company to not have one person to do call backs or the Manager that was left the voicemail not return a call is unacceptable.   Not a good experience, flight to California was very full, the last two row were empty but the flight attendants wouldn’t let anyone sit there and old me “no more questions” when I asked about it. The flight attendants were not very vigilant in checking that people wear masks. Many people took they’re masks off. Almost all the flights I took were very full and the people I sat next to did not always have they’re masks on. Boarding was quick and easy and the flight went as planes but the COVID precautions were not up to par. I’m pretty disappointed.  I had a very important question about my flight and was unable to get actual answers from customer service. Calling was useless, with extremely long wait times, then an agent who couldn\\'t answer my question. AA offers zero email or chat support options! Their website only lets you contact them about a short list of very specific issues. But a general question about my flight? Apparently I\\'m not allowed to ask that. Caused a lot of unnecessary stress that could have been avoided if they simply offered a support email like every other company does. Ridiculous that I can\\'t get simple answers.   There was a woman with 4 children, approximately ages 4-16 not wearing masks from the time they entered the Bakersfield terminal through 1 hour of the flight when I complained to the stewardess. This is in spite of the fact “Masks are Required” is posted on the American airline website, on the terminal entrance and throughout the airport and repeated with the flight instructions on the plane. I had to be the bad guy because No terminal or airline employee ever addressed the problem at check-in, at security, boarding the plane or in flight. The stewardess talked to the mom and the captain then told me that the captain said children aren’t required to wear masks and mom said the oldest has a condition that excuses her from wearing a mask and we need to be courteous to those that can’t wear masks. I replied that no where does any airline literature say children are exempt from wearing masks. I reminded them that the coved-19 virus doesn’t care about age. I then asked for them to show some proof that they were unable to wear a mask for some rare medical reason. Of course they had been lying and couldn’t provide any proof. The stewardess again asked me to be courteous because they are not required to wear a mask. I again reminded her that all the airport/airline literature said it was required and that that family were the ones who weren’t being considerate to everyone on that plane just because they didn’t want to wear a mask. The oldest kid put on her mask. The other kids never did. I refused to drop the issue. The stewardess asked us to move seats. We moved but I reminded the stewardess that they were still potentially exposing everyone on the plane to this virus and I wasn’t happy about having to change seats because someone else was inconsiderate of everyone else’s health. Again, why didn’t someone from the terminal or airline ever address this issue prior to 1 hour into the flight?   \\r\\nInstead of being at my home with my family in Greece celebrating orthodox Easter, I am in hotel in Chicago. Our flight was delayed multiple times until it was cancelled, there was no warning, we just had to waste 8 hours at the airport until American Airlines admitted they could not staff the flight. They send us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere. After such a long day I can\\'t even have a drink or smoke a cigarette.   I recently flew on American Airlines to pick up my 84 year old Mom in Utah from Maui. I asked for wheelchair accommodations for my Mom for each connecting flight. I want to thank American Airlines for the excellent service that was provided at every gate. A wheelchair and an agent was waiting at every gate. The agent was very professional and asked if any bags needed to be gathered or restroom service was needed. The agent was very considerate, polite, and worked hard going from one gate to the next. Upon our return to Maui we were escorted to the CDC Covid clearance area, which was quite a walk, and assisted by airport personnel. Then we were escorted to the elevator, then to baggage claim. The agent was awesome! For pre-boarding my mothers name was paged prior to boarding which allowed her to get to her seat safely. The assistance provided was a help mate for me as I just followed the agent to each gate. Thank you American Airlines for making my flight pleasant and for taking care of my Mom. A special shout out to the flight attendants who work hard on the plane serving drinks and making our flight comfortable. Much appreciated ... only a small delay leaving Maui, all of the other flights were on time or ahead of schedule. Thank you for no canceled flights during Covid. I will use American Airlines when I fly and thank you for assisting stranded passengers from other flights.   This is about the worst experience ever. My flight was to leave at 11:00 from Tampa to Florida. Something happened and they asked everyone to change their flight to another plane without reason. From 11:00 am my direct flight to Philly was changed to 3.31 flight with a connecting flight to Charlotte then Philly. My kids and I waited four hours to get on the next flight just for the lady in the front desk to be bluntly rude and disrespectful to just about every customer. I’m watching her yell at other customers while they were just trying to get their boarding pass. Finally we are in the plane and and the flight delayed again which means I’m definitely missing my next plane to Philly. After all we went through they take everyone off the plane and they don’t know where my baggage is, basically they lost it. All my clothes and my kids clothes gone and all they can say is that they can’t do anything about it.  I have special dietary restrictions, so meal reservations take priority when flying. I have two complaints re this matter. 1. Due to faulty and misleading wording/information stated on website re meal reservation for flights, we are all wasting time. When contacting live reps, we are given inconsistent information. See below for reference: Site AND app state, in this exact wording: You can reserve a meal beginning 30 days (and up to 24 hours) before your flight. Available within 30 days of departure EVERY time Ive come across this issue, Im told its not available to reserve yet, even though its been 30 or less days prior to flight. Web techies could save us (and AA reps) time by adjusting this information to read less misleadingly. Idea: “You can reserve a meal up to 24 hours before your flight. (In select cases, this option may be available as early as 30 or less days before departure.)” Ive contacted them several times about this over the years. Nothing has changed. 2.They never have vegan options, only vegetarian. Most reps seem to not know the difference between the two. When I have had to speak with one over the phone, many times, Im given attitude, as if Im simply being picky and a nuisance. Veganism is more than just a diet - it’s an entire lifestyle, much like religious restrictions, such as kosher. I wonder if religious restrictions are given the same impatient attitude. I doubt it. Whats the problem with people who arent vegan getting so threatened with veganism? Im not preaching to them or trying to convert! Live and let live with respect. Solution: provide vegan options. Again, multiple times requests on this. No change. AA doesnt actually care about individuals, only their money.   Bad business practices on multiple levels. I have been corresponding for months with AA over a charge dispute that occurred when I called their 800#. I have emailed all the way to the C-suite, provided pages of back up and detail, and thought the issue was resolved. I have multiple communication with the representatives from AA that \"there was no charge\". Then, when my credit card bill arrives, surprise! There is a charge. So I politely contact them again and now all of the sudden I have to deal with a third party company and not them - \"it\\'s not their problem\". Yet, I only ever contacted AA?? And they didn\\'t know this 3 months ago? Bait and Switch or just poor service standards? As someone in the service industry, I have made it a point to be professional in behavior and in my communications. This is not a failure on the poor representatives they have contacting me. It\\'s a failure at the C-suite level and that is a shame. This was an easy fix and they failed.   I needed assistance for my elderly mother. There was someone who helped us for all 3 flights. Staff were very friendly. Aircraft was spotless. Very happy with the service.   This is not a friendly airline. I tried to call before and during my trip (1.5 month) without luck. There is no way to message with no one and, frankly, I\\'m totally disappointed. The plane ticket was overpriced and it seems more overpriced for the service received by the customer. First, I was unable to pay for my bags online, second, on the phone the waiting time was over 8 hours, ridiculous! Third, no one helps when you don\\'t know what to do on those kiosks, despite of having personnel walking around. This is not a senior citizen friendly airline. I requested a wheelchair and have to practically beg for one and by the time I arrived in Colombia, there were no wheelchairs available. Having an American Advantage Citi card gave me no advantage at all, because no one answered the phone before my trip, so I paid $84.00 for my bag. I\\'m closing that account, it\\'s worthless. I do not recommend AA for travels, unless you like troubles!   Indianapolis to Chicago. At a level, it feels a shame to critique airlines in the current crisis; however, when one\\'s memory is of terrible service, uncaring employees, and being metaphorically charged for just about everything except breathing, one can\\'t have much sympathy for the American carriers. To describe this particular regional service as basic would be an exaggeration. American Airlines attitude seems to be to \"get the cattle on the truck\", and then act as if they were doing passengers a great service by providing a plastic up of ice water. Thank goodness this flight was short, and on time. Seats were incredibly uncomfortable, wifi did not work as usual. Difficult to avoid this airline, due to their relative monopoly in the USA. I wouldn\\'t want taxpayers money to bail them out.   Worst experience I have ever had flying. Constant flight changes just for customers like me to get there at 6 in the morning for the flight to be canceled 20 minutes before boarding and proceeding to be stranded in a state I am not familiar with, then to also be charged $81 just to go back home after I had already paid for my two flights.   Every time I fly American, it makes me believe that even Spiritt surpasses AA. I will never in my life take American Airlines again. When your flight is delayed, they still board you. I have been stuck on this plane for 3 hours and haven’t taken off yet. They should have at least allowed us to get off. If you think spirit is bad, this airline makes them look better.   Kicked us in the behind twice within the same day. Delayed multiple times in one day. Was suppose to depart at 6am and didn’t actually depart till 2pm. They made us late; booked us another flight without telling us. Didn’t actually put us on the flight bc it was printed. Have our luggage in limbo, have us waiting on multiple standbys therefore wasting our time - if the standby flights do not have enough seats for us; we have to wait for a flight 3 days after. Refuse to refund us if we want to cancel and rebook another airline despite they being at fault. Refuse to assume responsibility.   Delay upon delay after delay. Flight out had to deplane and wait an hour. Flight home had to reply and currently at 4.5 hours. Had to change planes and they still haven’t finished loading luggage after a four hour delay. Pathetic. No onboard entertainment. The only snacks to purchase are peanuts and pringles. Very little communication from crew as to delays.  Absolutely the worst airline there is. Delayed my luggage, which had nightly medication needed and tried for literally 2 days to get the damn bag from 2 hours away. Numerous flights in and numerous idiots who not simply just put the bag on the plane to me. Do not use this airline, the lack of customer is very poor.   Flight was delayed and caused us to miss our connection. Had to fly to different airport and drive five hours to get to our final destination. Ended up having to pay over $350 for the new rental car since we never made it to our original airport. American does not care whatsoever. No apologies, no compensation, nothing. About to fly back home and tried to move our flight up a couple hours in case they delay us again, we would have a backup option. They have seats on the earlier flight but want $200 extra for each ticket to be put on that flight. I would never use this airline again. Go ahead and use this if you want to be nickel and dimed to death and end up with the worse service ever.  Due to a lack of American Airlines employees checking in customers at the ticketing/checked baggage desk located within the Salt Lake City International Airport as well as poor customer service, we were not able to make our 8am flight. After multiple delays at SLC and DFW, we finally arrive in LBB to discover our bags were incorrectly offloaded at DFW and waiting in the baggage claim area. You would think it would be an easy fix to have my bag flown from DFW to LBB on one of the 5 nonstop flights which occur throughout the day. However, after notifying both DFW and American Airlines multiple times throughout the day, my bag has continued to sit at the baggage service desk at DFW after nearly 36 hours. Despite going without crucial pain medication for going on 2 days, the customer service representatives have been unwilling and/or unable to accomplish the simple task of transferring my bag on a flight to LBB. I’m so desperate at this point were it not for my one-year-old daughter, I would have them book me a round trip ticket to pick up the bag myself as it is seems this major airline is incapable of the simple task of sending me my “already found” bag.   They made me miss my flight even though I was in line for over an hour before to check in my bag. Only one person was working and she spent over half and hour with one family. The plane still had 30 mins left to board and they wouldn’t let me board. I ended up missing my flight even though the plane was there. A first class seat was available, but I was told I had to pay to get that seat even though no one was sitting there. It wasn’t my fault for “missing my flight”. How does one miss a plane if the plane still has 30 mins left before departure? I had to get another ticket on standby and no one will compliment anything or work with me. It’s really sad how customers are treated here. I have flown internationally and domestically my whole life and have never had this happen.  I should’ve stuck with United   I will never fly American again and I could cite my recent trip to Orlando as the reason why as I found my checked luggage to be damage and unusable except the return flight to Phoenix was even worse. The staff on the plane are unpersonable in my opinion. The safety demo is a recording and not a flight attendant like the other airline I travel. We land in Phoenix about on normal time despite a delay out of Orlando. I go to the baggage claim carousel to wait for my 3 bags (2 luggage, ((1 new because of the damage on the flight there) and 1 car seat). The 2 bags come out no problem but no sign of car seat which is in a bag for added protection. After about 20 minutes my wife goes to baggage assistance to see if size is an issue. They say it\\'ll be on the carousel, after another 15 minutes the carousel stops turning. My turn to go into the baggage assistance where they cant go by name but a number on the tag which they issue when I check in so why cant they check by name. She needs the tags so I grab the bag that was in my name as my wife had her bag and the car seat was in my name so I only needed mine. The lady is a little incompetent on that and thinks I\\'m missing 2 bags so I have to explain it to her again. There also is no concern on their part that I cant leave the airport as I don\\'t have my car seat. She just smiles and happily says were trying and no sorry or nothing. In her calls I learn it was scanned off the plane at 1045am, its currently 1120am when I\\'m talking with this lady and still no car seat. It finally pops onto the carousel at 1123am so almost 45 mins for a car seat to get to baggage claim when my other bags were there in 5-10 minutes. Unacceptable and delaying my 2 hour drive home and finally a sorry you had to wait as I walked to retrieve my car seat. I will pay double or triple before I fly American again.   Worst experience ever, a two hour flight was delayed by 4 hours as of right now and to make it worse two of it was inside the plane. If it was an individual that was late even for one minute for what ever reason no one will open it. If American Airlines wasn’t fully equipped and ready to good service maybe they shouldn’t give one at all.   First time flying with American Airlines and the last! Our flight out of Albuquerque was late, but we boarded an hour late and thought we would make our connecting flight. We sat for another hour in the plane and were told there was a cabin light that was not working and did not need to be fixed to fly, but the pilot chose to hold the plane up anyway. We had to run to our connecting gate at DFW. Our luggage did not get on the plane. When we got to Key West, a baggage claim employee told us we would probably not get our bags until the 4:30 flight the next day. We just questioned why as there was two earlier flights. She apparently did not like being questioned and just gave us our baggage tickets back and said there was nothing else she could do. We were getting married the next day and all our wedding attire was in those bags! We called the airline customer service the next morning and found out she never filed a baggage claim ticket tracking either and were told the bags would be on the 1:20 flight from Miami. When we went to the airport to get the bags, the baggage claim supervisor had taken our bags off the carousel, came into the terminal, called our names and we were instructed to go talk to him at the baggage claim window. He told us that Tracy had indicated we were intoxicated and using foul language when speaking to her the day before. Both of those statements were a lie. Unless American Airlines over serves their customers, there is no way we were drunk. We were on their planes from 9 am until 4:30 pm with no layovers. Secondly, my fiance does not swear, just ridiculous! He told us we had two options, either apologize to the staff or he would send our luggage with a delivery service and we would get it sometime that day. We told him we were getting married in a few hours and our wedding attire was in those bags. He said he understood, but those were our options. So he held our luggage hostage and basically forced us to apologize to the staff for something that never happened, just so we could get our luggage and get married. I would like to know where our apology is from American for ruining our entire wedding day! I cried all night and most of the next morning because we thought we were going to have to cancel our wedding. I had so much anxiety that by the time we did get our luggage, the wedding was hard to enjoy. Thank you for altering what should have been one of the happiest days of our life, getting no apology from you and acting like your airline was the victim!   First of all we are newlyweds we had assigned seats, and seating assignments were changed, had to ask different customers so we can sit together .. ridiculous.. Couldn\\'t imagine why they changed our seats and coming on a full flight they changed our seating again didn\\'t get this program. I\\'m 6\\'2 had a aisle seat, they placed me in the middle seat, between married couple. Terrible, as well as my wife in a middle 2 rows ahead. Crazy business had to ask customers again to sit next my wife. Thanks for the unprofessionalism American   Horrible experience. Booked first class. Flight there, no problems. Flight back was supposed to depart at 11.30 pm. Was delayed due to not enough staff. Finally at 1.30am, they cancelled the flight. Could not get another flight until the following day and not first class or even seats together. Didn\\'t get to the ticket counter about a hotel stay until after 6am - horrible. Will never, ever fly America again. Spirit had much better service!   When we booked our reservation, it was last minute and when we got to the airport we realized that we are not seated together. At the ticket counter the agent said that in order for my friend to sit with me, there is an upgrade fee to a better seat with leg room. We thought it was odd, but we bought the ticket for $31.16. When we got to the plane, there was NO DIFFERENCE between the seat that he was in and the seat that he moved to except to sit next to me. No leg room difference. I disputed it with the flight attendant, I also had taken down the name of a witness who thought it was ridiculous and I disputed it with the customer service when I got back into town. They swore up and down that it was a more premium seat and refuse to refund the $31.16 fee that was needlessly and deceptively sold to us. I don\\'t recommend flying with American Airlines as they overcharge and don\\'t do right when so much proof is presented.   They didn\\'t schedule any staff to fly the plane. They said will be 11:30 before any staff even show up, and will still need time to get across the airport and do whatever they need to do on the plane. I spent $200 on a motel room I\\'ll barely get to use, if at all, and they aren\\'t offering as much as an apology for the inconvenience. By the time I get to my destination I will have been up for over 24 hours with a two hour drive left to go when I finally get to where I was going. This mistake has cost me money, time, and has thoroughly exhausted me. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they find a way to further delay this flight.   AA 1124 flight got delay it cause me to lose my connection flight AA 1246 on Sept 14, 2022 AA. agent told me in BAQ airport that she needed to re-schedule my connection because i was going to miss it - turn out AA 1246 got delayed as well and she had canceled my flight and rescheduled a new one for next day without providing me with further information. When I arrive to MIA to connect with my flight, I was unable to go inside because ticket was cancelled in BAQ airport. I went to customer service, no hotel was provided, no food was provided for passengers who came on time and have everything in order. I don\\'t understand this treatment. i have to stay in MIA airport from 8:45 pm sept 14, 2022 to 6:30 am on Sept 15. I arrived to YYZ but baggage stayed in Miami.   My flight was canceled from Charlotte to Tampa. I was notified while in Costa Rica so I notified the American Airlines check in person in Costa Rica, she advised me that there would be no problem and have a room for me when I got to charlotte. I got to Charlotte notified the representative and she looked it up and stated that they could not give me a room and that it was not their fault. Then I went to the supervisor. She stated they ran out of vouchers and I was on my own, that I would need to find my own room after they canceled my flight. I was upset and did not want to spend 200.00 on a room. Then out of the blue received a text that I had a room ready. American Airlines representatives need training on how to treat customers. Then when I went to check in my baggage the next day, i let them know my flight the next day and advised I did not want to pay for another baggage fee the representative was rude and wanted to see my receipt. I will never fly American Airlines again.   Arrived at 10:00am for 10:30pm flight. Tried to take earlier flight and were told no seats available on any other flights to Nashville. Tried to buy day passes to Admiral Club to have comfortable place to wait and were told no day passes being sold. Later walked to terminal where another flight was departing and were told there was plenty of room. Went to customer service and were told there wAs room on that flight but now it’s gone. Another flight at 7:30 is full and we could be put on standby but our bags can’t be pulled from check in, which the first person did. So here we are, first class passengers sleeping on the floor in the terminal when seats are empty on planes, but AA can’t be bothered to help. Also, no food or drinks served while we waited in plane to take off and no food served during flight. Very disappointed in AA.   Worst experience ever! We were flying out of VPS and they cancelled our flight at the last minute leaving us stranded! My father who has a severe medical condition does not have enough medication to last him 2 days. All the employees are half hearted and could not care less about you. They don’t even give you food vouchers! Worst nightmare ever. Please take my advice and do not let this happen to you!   I\\'ve worked customer service for 15 years. I have never been this angry about the poorest customer service in my life. American Airlines updated my brother\\'s flight almost 2 hours early. I booked the flight 2 months ago in August. My notification was only a few hours before. He was held up for about 35 min. during check-in & security. We couldn\\'t get his 1 bag checked in, so I demanded a supervisor. I waited beside her waiting for her to be done with someone she was speaking with. She looked at me, then looked pass me. She said she thought someone else was waiting for her first. She was rude along with the baggage claim woman I spoke to because my brother is rushing for his flight. I spoke to 2 supervisors at the airport. They told me to contact Priceline with my booking about the flight change. Priceline told me to contact American Airlines. Then, the last supervisor tells me to talk to a supervisor at the airport. She clearly didn\\'t hear me, \"I did that already!\" Saying the line is recorded. I know it\\'s recorded. I did not curse at her. I threatened to review American Airlines on social media and all the sites I can. I\\'ve already done 3, and I\\'m not going to stop. She wasn\\'t sympathetic, she wasn\\'t helpful and she didn\\'t remedy the issue in any way. My brother is the sweetest guy you\\'ll ever meet. 12 hours on standby without guarantee of a flight? Really? He was polite to everyone he spoke to at the airlines & airport. This is the 2nd time I\\'ve had a poor experience with this airline. Everybody got me playing the telephone game. The supervisors are useless. Some employees are beyond rude. Some wanted to tell him what gate he should be at, others don\\'t. What kind of nonsense is that? This is the worst airline I\\'ve ever dealt with. Never again I will never recommend this airline to anyone.   The most terrible experience today - the were not able to accommodate us with disability. The put us in the end of the plane to walk on crutches, even though we’re were willing to pay for the seats in the front of the plane. The checkin desk person told us no need to buy tickets then, and that people at the gate will be able to accommodate us. No true! Everybody was extremely rude at the gate, don’t even try to assign us seats that are appropriate with injuries, more over they told us to board last, standing (on crutches) and waiting for all people to move through the plane. On a top of that there was no room for our luggage, because we checked in last. Will never fly this airline again and don’t recommend anybody with special needs ever fly this airline!   Return flight to LAX. Flight out AA 265 wonderful, multiple choice meal, drinks, IFE functioning. Return AA 266 provided the worst culinary slop ever seen. IFE not working entire 5 1/2 hr flight. Flight attendants fantastic, mostly being apologetic for food service and lack of IFE. Business class, had only one fixed menu consisting of: no appetizer, an entree of beans and quinoa - navy beans, kidney beans, fava beans. For the medical audience, fava beans can induce a hemolytic blood crisis in patients with an enzyme deficiency. To not offer any choice definitely put passengers at risk. Grapes and processed cheese. Processed cheese! Luscious dessert - Oreos in a foil packet. There was at least a choice of two different crackers! I\\'ve attached a photo of the delectable repast. The flight attendants all advised writing letters to AA at aa.com, as this was not the first time the Lihue-LAX flight was shortchanged in quality. The letter was subsequently sent on the aa.com complaint window. As a frequent flyer, we normally would expect some amends in terms of a mileage bonus or something considering the fare paid, the lack of any IFE on a long haul flight, and the abysmal meal served. This was their response, suspect automated: October 19, 2022 Hello xxxxx: Thank you for contacting American Airlines. We strive to put our customers at the center of everything we do. The details you provided highlight the importance of that focus, and we are sorry to hear things did not go as planned. Please know that we strive to learn from every experience, so we appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us. Your input will be shared with our team as we continue towards our goal of providing a world class experience. Thank you again for reaching out to share your experience with us. We hope to better deliver on our high standard of excellence next time we have the opportunity to welcome you aboard. Sincerely, xxxxx Customer Relations American Airlines AA. Your opinion matters to us! We invite you to share your overall experience in this quick one minute survey. Click here for the survey. We appreciate your time and valuable feedback. The biggest laugh came from the one minute survey, where first question was \" How likely are you to refer friends and family to American Airlines ?\". AA didn\\'t lose a customer, though I would never fly that route again on AA. They have lost a lot of my respect, and lost any referrals that I might have given. Loyalty means nothing to AA - a common sentiment, no doubt.   Flying from small town to small town meant three layovers, but somehow flying from the northwest (Oregon) to New England (Maine) meant staying 15 hours in Phoenix? They asked if I would check my bags without telling me that my long layover meant I’d have to go to baggage claim and check it again several hours later and then go back thru security. Nobody I talked to seemed interested in helping me. So frustrated. There was more on my round trip back that also just showed poor organization and lack of interest in their passengers’ experience. Also WiFi didn’t work on any of the flights I tried.   I had the worst experience flying American in all of my years of travel. It began in the Des Moines Airport where there was not enough staff to cover the 3 flights that were leaving that morning. None of the kiosks would print bag tags (and yes, we tried at SEVEN of them). When we got to the front of the line, the customer service person said \\'sorry, you will have to get in another line to have bag tags printed - however the cutoff has now passed for getting your luggage on your flight, so you will have to rebook\\'.  There were at least 60+ people in the line behind us, most of which had already missed their flight and were being told to rebook for another day. Unacceptable. One of our party was able to get on the phone with Diane - a very helpful AA staffer who got us on a flight thru United to Denver to make a connecting flight on to PVR. We were able to still arrive at our destination that day. A week later when we tried to return home the nightmare continued. We were able to board our first flight, but then circled the airport waiting to land for 60 minutes. While we were in the air, our connecting flight out of O\\'Hare was cancelled. The AA service representative got us on another United flight, but because we were unable to land (air traffic control issues?) we missed that connection. AA was unable to get us on any other flights that day - claiming weather issues so that they did not have to pay for us to stay in a hotel overnight. So another $200 later we had to return early morning the next day and try to get home. ONE of our party was able to return to DSM while the other two of us had to go to CID and find someone to retrieve us and drive us to DSM for our vehicle. \\' I will never fly with American again. I will pay more to have service from Delta, Allegiant, or Southwest where I have never encountered such ineptitude. I was willing to say \\'everyone has a bad day\\', but AA is having a bad day/week/month!   We booked our flight 17 weeks prior to our vacation in Curaçao (lay over in Miami). The flight on American Airlines had a 6am departure. It was later changed to 7:05am … which gave us a 87 minute window to get to our flight to next flight at gate D40. We did not depart from ORD until 7:56. There was no explanation except that the food truck was unloading their goods. We arrived at gate D4 with less than twenty five minutes to make our gate. We were at back of the plane full of passengers. An announcement was made by flight stewards that those not pressed to make a connection should allow those that did have a connection be given deplaning priority. That was the last of any help by the apathetic airline staff. They just stood around making small talk. First, there was no weather related issue to delay departure. Plane was not arriving from anywhere else. We were sited almost at the very rear of the plane when itinerary was clear that we had a connection gate a distance away. My wife and I ran (even with a recent need replacement for my 76 year old knee). The airline staff was rude, apathetic, and lazy. There was little assistance. It was like “ we have your money, you are on your own). The return flight was as bad with the agent giving us the wrong boarding passes, causing immigration to detain us. Then our arrival at Miami-Dade was chaos. With immigration, baggage exchange, two sky trains and a mile and a half travel, we just made our flight. One, I will avoid AA. Two, I will avoid Miami Dade airport. Three, there appears to be a real lack of any customer service or consideration by American Airlines.   Multiple cancellations and delays. Initial flight delayed, missed connecting flight so flew from Philly to DFW for early AM connection to San Diego. (I had to pay for the hotel, apparently they don’t cover weather delays). Flight cancelled from DFW, rescheduled for 12 hours later, not ok. Barely had enough time to book with an alternate airline, even though I called AA customer service they were not helpful, and will not refund the canceled flight. I have never flown with American before and I will never use this airline again. I would rather pay higher prices for a more competent airline then ever fly with American.  Toronto to Dallas via Guadalajara. If I could give American Airlines 0 stars I would. We arrived to Toronto early to ensure we made our 6:30 AM flight. We were stuck on the tarmac for deicing, we thought this was no big deal and we took off. Midflight in we realized we might miss our flight to Guadalajara. In flight, they had no information about connecting flights, which I have experienced on other airlines. Upon landing in Dallas we learned we in fact missed our flight and were directed to customer service. At this point we were told to call a number whilst in line, however, they told us that we should go to the counter anyway so that was a waste of a phone call. We get to the counter and they put us on standby for a flight out later that evening and booked us on a flight for the following day guaranteed. We asked about a hotel voucher because it appeared we were delayed due to waiting for deicing in Toronto. However, we were told that it was due to \"long lines at U.S customs\". We do not believe this as the flight door did close at the scheduled time. We wait for hours in Dallas and make it to the gate. We were told the flight was full, but they would have more information after boarding. Midway through boarding, we were informed there was a mechanical issue with the plane, everyone had to migrate to another terminal to grab another plane. The boarding process began again. When it came to standby everyone got on except for myself and my husband as there was only one seat left. My husband became visibly upset and they just stared at us with \"we just need a yes or no\". We get that it is beyond our control, but we just wanted some compassion. We were rudely directed back to customer service. We went and pleaded for a hotel voucher and were just given a blank stare and once again told there is nothing the airline can do to help us. We missed a day of our vacation and were out $200 for a hotel. All in all, the staff were not helpful and we just wished that we got an apology. We will never be flying American Airlines again.   Had a horrible experience with the ground airline staff from this airline. She requested us riding the coach to check in our hand carry bags claiming that the overhead cabins were full which we totally understand. We had 2 of our hand carries checked in, and one of us did not have any hand carry. But that woman insisted and just tagged the bag that we wanted to take in with us, I believe that if every passenger is entitled to 1 hand carry it shouldn\\'t be a problem. My problem is when we went inside the plane there were open spaces in the luggage cabin, I say this because I was one of the last people to get inside and the cabins are still open, and some people behind me were able to bring in theirs. At the end of the flight again some people have big bags, so where is the fairness when they claim to give the best service to the public.   My flight was delayed until 5:38. I was assured by the gate agent that it would not take off before 5:38. I went to eat and returned at 5:05 and the gate was closed and I was unable to board the plane. I’ll never fly American again.   My experience with American has been very poor. Our flight on Christmas Eve was delayed four hours for a ten hour direct flight which was already exhausting enough. The customer service quickly left after this was announced and actively avoided answering questions. We weren\\'t compensated in any way. The food and beverages ran out on the plane both departing and returning, and the items that were left were just plain gross. These tickets were astronomically high and the service received was just poor. No one was able to answer questions about where to head once landing in Hawaii due to Covid restrictions (there are checkpoints you have to go through to enter Hawaii.) We wandered around the airport unaware of the protocol for over an hour after landing, we had to ask other random passengers. Very very sad.   Extremely unprofessional. Flight to Buffalo was delayed and moved gates multiple times. At gate D2 a flight to Austin delayed the flight to Buffalo due to staffing issues as Buffalo was supposed to arrive at D2. Gate was switched AGAIN. Buffalo was announced to be delayed due to staffing issues as well. Then after all the delays, it was postponed overnight due to weather. Weather would not have been an issue if it wasn\\'t delayed so many times due to other issues. No accommodations, but the flight to Austin received them, the flight that influenced OUR flight. AA staff then proceeded to tell ALL of us, that we heard the announcement wrong. Although our flight was delayed due to other flight staffing issues, we received NO accommodations. The staff then proceeded to be nasty to us and give us attitude for calling out AA that the flight would have departed before weather had it not been for other delays. They acted extremely unprofessional and nasty. Then I had walked by the staff mocking and laughing at the frustrated Buffalo flyers. So all of us heard the announcement wrong? Seems to me like AA lies to the face of their customers and doesn\\'t want to dish out more cash for their mistakes. I can only hope somebody recorded the interaction and makes it go viral. I personally spent money on a blanket and pillow so to be somewhat comfortable sacrificing my health and sleep for AA\\'s mistakes.   Worst airline ever. We were delayed for two hours because they didn’t bring the plane. For two hours they couldn’t update us and kept pushing back our board time. There was no reason for this. Also none of the staff were wearing their face masks properly. Save yourself the anxiety and use a different airline!   American Airlines should be shut down. My luggage was left in Miami, I traveled in a wheelchair due to my current disability. I desperately need my luggage. There is no way to contact them on the phone, (can’t even get on the call back cue). No responses from emails.   I will never fly with this airline again. On 7/16, my husband and I were returning from a very much needed vacation from Montego Bay Jamaica and had a connecting flight from MIA to Boston. Upon the flight being delayed 4 times they eventually cancelled the flight all together leaving us confused because this is the first time we\\'ve experienced this issue. Lady at the desk told us to rebook at gate 14 so my husband and everyone else went to gate 14 only to find out we were in the wrong place. After waiting 3 hours in line we found out there would be no more flights from MIA to Boston until 2 days later. Both my husband and I were expected to return to work the following day yet now we are stuck in FL for 2 additional days. I went to another gate that had just boarded near by, a flight going to Rio de Janeiro, to ask if they knew where we could find our luggage and to my shock the 2 women behind the desk were talking trash about the people waiting in the now 5 hour line to rebook cancelled flights. I stood there as the 2 employees spoke to each other saying how the people standing in line are \"stupid because they are wasting their time because customer service wont help them\" and laughed about how they would be going home soon after their shifts. Upset I approached the woman behind the desk and let her know that I was one of the people standing in line and looked at me wide eyed as the other employee walked away I asked her if she could do something besides speaking on people she doesn\\'t know and tell me where I can locate my luggage. She told me I would have to go elsewhere to baggage customer service and ask them and told me to please be patient and I replied just like I was now when she felt the need to make fun of people she doesn\\'t know. I walked away and my husband and I went downstairs to find the baggage customer service and after waiting in line yet again for an hour, another employee walked over to tell everyone in line that we are wasting our time. He announced that all the baggage from the canceled flights were in back and no one is going through them because it\\'s too many luggage to go through. Everyone in line became very upset, some yelling at the employee asking what he meant. One man lost his mind telling the baggage guy that the people from upstairs sent him down here for his bags and the baggage guy told him that they only do ticketing and we do baggage and said they don\\'t know what their talking about and no one from the canceled flights would be getting their bags. Angry I went up to the desk to ask if there was anyway possible to retrieve our luggage, we will now be in FL for 2 days without clothes and bags. Also 5mths pregnant, all of my clothes and other things were in my luggage. The lady at the desk told us she had no idea where our luggage is but she would put some note into the system so me and my husband would be able to pick up our luggage at the customer service desk in the morning. Upon searching for hotels for the night as I am pregnant and refused to sleep in the airport and of course everywhere near the airport was booked up. We found a hotel by luck and got there after 5am the next morning 3 more hours later after using Uber to get around town looking for available rooms. Next morning we went back to baggage only to find out the girls note was overridden and our bags were now in Boston so we had no luggage. How are we to be compensated for all the time and money lost dealing with the AA employees?  Miami airport is the worst I\\'ve seen. Few charging stations, delayed flights a million times, canceled flights with very little staff to help rebook. Nasty restrooms and changed gates a million times. You have to walk for miles for each gate. After changing my gate and flights a few times, they sent my suitcase to Tampa Florida which was my original connecting flight to get Dallas. It was supposed to me 3 hours and ended up having to go to Las Vegas to Dallas for 8 hours with my 10 year old. She was exhausted and so was I. We got home at 8 with no bag until 10. I slept for 1 hour and had to go back to get suitcase.   During this flight, I was traveling with my 2 children, ages 12 years old and 12 months old. During the flight, an attendant approached me and said my 12 month old son could not watch to the musical cartoon he on his tablet without headphones because it was bothering others on the flight. The attendant made it clear he did not care that I was just trying to keep my son entertained on the evening flight to prevent him from screaming on the 4 hour flight. If this is the representation of your airline, I don’t feel parents are welcome to bring their children on flights.   I will not fly American Airlines again. I purchased 3 seats and understood the seats could not be refunded. An emergency kept my daughter from flying with me. I was ok because it meant that we would be able to have a whole row to relax and share. Not only did American Airlines seat someone in my third seat but it was a huge, foul-smelling man. So, instead of enjoying my flight, I was squished and had to smell a man for 2 hours who’d obviously not washed. I am absolutely incensed by this.   Due to late incoming flight we were supposed to depart with roughly 1 hour delay. Expected delay was communicated via email and text. Due to well organized boarding we ended up leaving and arriving with only half an hour delay. Check in at YYZ was as usual fast, friendly, efficient and pleasant. Boarding was civilized which unfortunately is not always the case. Crew on board was great. All in all a nice experience.   Houston to Dallas. I had departed from American Airlines as on time stated, but arrived late, because they could not find any gate to drop of us off for about 17 minutes. Thus, I missed my connecting flight to my destination. This made me upset, because I was expecting to show up on the time I wanted to and now, I have to deal 7 hours of delay for another route all the way to Paris to get a connecting flight towards Ho Chi Minh City. The lady who assisted was nice and did her effort to help me as much as possible to arrive early, not to mention she also compensated me for a meal voucher due to this issue, which I am thankful for it. Still frustrated that I have to deal with delays and lack of rest. I will not ever fly American Airlnes anymore due to this experience. Do yourself a favor, don\\'t ever think about American Airlines, especially if you are traveling abroad. Look elsewhere.   If I could give them zero I would. Firstly, we have had delay on delay because they did not have enough staffing. Secondly, the staff openly lies to customers to de-escalate the situation. After our first delay in Raleigh the customer service rep assured us that we can have it communicated in Dallas that we would be able to announce a seat change. We arrive at Dallas and ask the AA rep to notify other passengers of other open seat options where she said “unfortunately our flight is full”. As the airplane took off, there were a significant amount of empty seats. Did I also mention when we flew into Raleigh they damaged out luggage by leaving it out in the rain for at least 15 minutes. I know this is a long review but save yourselves the grief of flying American and pick a different airline.   Terrible experience. I was scheduled to leave from gate A-23 they changed it at the last minute, I got to the gate when the door to the tarmac was still opened, when I get there one of the gal\\'s slams the door tells me rudely you are not getting on (already checked in on line seat assigned). I told her my seat was already paid for and assigned, then she gets more rude and obnoxious very unprofessional, I ask for her name and she proceeds to be rude and walks away had to go to customer service for there names. Will not be flying with American again. I\\'d rather pay a little bit more.   This has been the worst travel experience of my life. My flight was suppose to leave Miami to charlotte at 10:30pm. Flight ended up getting delayed 12.5hrs, and they didn’t even have a place for us to stay at night. We were stranded in the airport. However, they did give us a $12 voucher for food! Such an awful airline with awful customer service. Won’t be flying with them again. This ruined my week.  First of all they lost our baggage not once, not twice, but three times! Also the first flight we took back home stopped in Philly. Our flight from Miami to Philly was delayed an hour and fifty minutes because the captain forgot their “log book”. The flight we had from Charlotte to Miami was delayed due to weather, which is understandable. But after boarding we ended on waiting another hour for a caption because they didn’t think to have anyone ready to fly the plane before boarding it. All around a terrible flight experience and I legitimately paid the same amount of money for my seats on the flight that I did for the actual tickets. Not to mention I got seats right next to each other and on every flight I had I was not seated next to my boyfriend. Kinda disappointed honestly.  Dallas to London. First time on an international flight with AA Quite a significant departure from my experience on Qatar Airways from Doha. 1 asked for help with the in-flight WiFi as I could not log on. \"I don\\'t know how that works. You have to go to the browser\" that\\'s hard to deal with as a passenger. I eventually sorted it out. 2. Pressed the call sign so I could ask for a drink. Was told \"don\\'t press the call sign again as I will keep going up and down the aisle\" never been on a flight where I\\'m instructed not to call for service! I\\'m still midair about 90minutes into the flight and she hasn\\'t been down the aisle in 30 minutes. I feel like a student in a classroom. Its quite depressing I have 6hours and 5 minutes to go. The flight attendant finally walks down the aisle and I ask if I can have a pack of nuts \"will get you one if I can find it\"! A pack of nuts in the business class cabin on a transatlantic flight! Its ridiculous. British Airways needs to get another partner airline. I will definitely not be flying this airline again.   They pushed our flight back 5 hours with no explanation and simply just a text! You definitely should spend the extra money on a better airline if possible. The staff are friendly but just overall a very unorganized airline. Do not recommend putting yourself through this chaos. No partial refund or sorry for the inconvenience. Will never fly this airline by choice again.   We were delayed because of the weather. Saray (I hope it’s spelled correctly) obviously couldn’t offer anything more and I didn’t bother to ask. But once we were in the air, she continuously checked on us. She asked how our drinks were, how we were doing, if we needed her assistance etc. but it wasn’t just that, it was her amazing and friendly attitude that I adored. No one could be angry about the late flight because of her efforts to keep everyone uplifted. I even told her at the end she was amazing.  So bad! This was my first time flying during the Covid-19 pandemic and I was shocked! The plane was dirty, there was absolutely no social distancing and they are using COVID-19 to be lazy! There was no food service, even for the flight that was 6 hours long! Just drinks! Why can you had out drinks but not pre-packaged food? Additionally, I had to change my return flight to another airline and was assured that I would receive a credit. Well I called today and sure I get a credit - but it\\'s only good for the same route! So if I ever find myself in Hawaii with no return flight home - I can use the credit. What a joke! Everything I read and was told by the agent on the phone was that I would receive a credit! No one mentioned that it had to be for the same route. Well needless to say, I flew home on Delta to help my daughter with her kids and what a difference. The plane was not only extremely clean, they also handed us wipes as we got on if we wanted to wipe down our area even more! They also used social distancing on the plane! There were empty seat between travelers. They also had these baggies with an individual hand sanitizer, a Kind bar, a bag of Cheezits, and a water. And on the the 6 hour flight, they gave us this twice. American Airlines is the worst and they have definitely lost a customer! I feel let down and cheated! Never again!   Upon finding out the night before I was to depart that my flight was cancelled, I called to find out my options to reschedule. I was on hold to Customer Service for over eight hours with no response. I ended up going to the airport to talk to someone directly. I will never fly American again unless I have no other option. There is no acceptable excuse for the lack of communication. There were other negative ramifications due to the lack of response from American that I will not specify due to the length, but the ramifications are permanent and cannot be corrected.   They closed the door in the face of 10 people with tickets in hand at 6:25 am on Friday morning. Then told everyone to hang around for stand-by seats at 11am. Not one person was able to get on and rebooked everyone the next morning at 8:10, then posted a delay until 9am, then 9:50, then  10:45am. The employees run and hide so you can\\'t ask questions. AA is the worst run company that i have ever dealt with. and they just delayed it again until 11:15.   Chicago to Orlando. This is the worst airline ever! I\\'m appalled that they call themselves American. You have no freedom choosing your seats unless you pay for it. You have no freedom checking in even one luggage unless you pay for it. And you have no freedom of movement in these cramped seats! I will never fly with them again and you shouldn\\'t either!   First flight delayed, caused me to miss my connecting flight, then my new connecting flight delayed by a few hours. On top of that, we were supposed to fly into SNA. Mid flight, they diverted us to LAX. They knew we weren’t going to make it to SNA before the curfew but didn’t tell us we were going to LAX till half way through the flight. \\xa0 \\xa0Just upset. Again it is delayed. This year already I had 12 trips and 60% got delayed or canceled. I am still with AA because is my company policy, but I will fight to have this changed.   Waited over an hour in line to change my flight. They had about 100 people in line and only 1 agent. The online self service system didn’t let me make the change online because it was within 3 hours of flight. So after waiting the 1 plus hour to get to the agent, he was rude and unpleasant. He finally made the change though. I guess AA might be ok if you don’t want to do anything but pay and fly, but as soon as you need to make a change, forget it. I’ll stick with one of the other carriers after this experience.    Customer service 0/10. Literally don’t know anything, you should stop putting “contact us for further help” or anything along the lines of that if the agents literally just read what was emailed to the customer. Also, if you don’t have an account with them, expect even less.   Worst flight experience I’ve had in a very long time and I have had years where I flew over 50 flights. Missed connection coming in to DFW, misled by flight crew, no gate agents would speak to me, had to get in the only customer service line which was hours long, my luggage arrived nearly 24 hours after I did when I got to my final destination. Captain actually came back and asked us if we had seen anyone loading luggage and then shrugged. What a mess. Gate crews were rude and unconcerned. Will never fly American Airlines again.   Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. American airlines is the worst airline, they changed my flight twice even before getting on the plane. Then canceled my flight home leaving me with one lost day of vacation and not being able to use my paid hotel and rental car. When I asked for any accommodation they said no,vthis happens all the time   Our first leg of the trip was delayed by American arriving late into HHH so our take off was delayed. Due to this our connection in Clt to Philadelphia was missed. A trip that should have taken 3 hours, took 15 hours. The delays in and out of Charlotte airport on American are despicable! This same delay has an entire plane of people running to catch connections that could have been made but instead it’s “no big deal” to rebook 100 people. I’ll never fly American Airlines again.   The worst airline ever. My son is graduating from basic training tomorrow and we are going to miss everything because of American Airlines. The airline completely ruined this experience for our children and for the family, our kids that we have not seen in 2 months and they are going to be looking for our faces tomorrow during their run and we will not be there for them because of American Airlines.   One of the dirtiest planes I have ever been on. This month I flown on 4 different AA flights, and all the planes were less than that deal when it comes to cleanliness. The last flight though sent me over the edge; when I went to get in my seat there was spilled wine that had not been cleaned up, and crumbs all over the little table and arm rests. Even the guy next to me commented that they must have skipped cleaning this plane.   Absolutely horrible! I received a credit for a cancelled flight that I attempted to use to fly my son out for his military leave during Christmas. American Airlines wouldn\\'t let me use the credit due to the fact that his name wasn\\'t on the original ticket. It shouldn\\'t matter who is on the original ticket, it shouldn\\'t matter who paid for the ticket. I will never fly American Airlines again!   Las Vegas to Chicago. Worst travel experience of my life.  For the customer rep. to say \"its not my fault you missed you flight\" after I purchase a $400+ dollar new flight to leave the same day, its just sad. I spend 30 minutes on the phone with her to try get a new flight for her to try put me in a whole new flight. It defeated the purpose of spending the money and the displeasure of having to be on the phone with such a nasty and hateful person. Never again.   We have to fly from ABQ to MI for several important medical treatments in Dec 2022. In Oct. the airline cancelled our afternoon return flight from MQT and offered 2 choices: take the only other flight and miss our 2 treatments on the last morning there or incur the costs of food, extra day rental car and motel stay to fly out the next day. We are barely staying up with medical bills and home repairs (leaking roof, broken water heater) and the extra $250-$275 to stay the extra day means something will not get paid. They don’t give a hoot about how it impacts the people who keep them in business. Shame on American Airlines. This is the last time we will ever give them our money! I rated the other aspects based on my previous flights with this airline.   This airline seems to be in its last throes; no control of their scheduling, lack of information, you travel at your own peril, not knowing if and when your plane will ever leave. This airline should disappear from the market once and for all, for the good of the public.  American Airlines: Absolute disrespect and disregard for their customers. I flew American Airlines from Boise to Phoenix. We left late. The flight attendant said they were waiting for 2 people. Once the 2 people showed up we didn\\'t leave. The pilot stated on the intercom that the flight was overbooked and they were waiting for 4 people to argue it out for the 1 empty seat. Once the final person was on, we left. Again, we were now late leaving Boise. We were scheduled to leave at 1:48 and the doors closed at 2:04, left about 5 minutes later. We were scheduled to arrive at 2:54 arrived at 2:58, so the pilot made up much of the time. We got to the gate at 3:03. I was off the plane by 3:11. I ran from gate A2 to gate A22. It\\'s a much larger trek than it seems since it\\'s a different arm of the terminal. I\\'m 65 and have COPD so this run was very difficult, but I am still pretty fast. I heard my name over the intercom as I ran so I just kept running. By the time I got to the gate, I was breathless and couldn\\'t speak. The door to the tarmac was closed, but they opened it and I ran 3/4 down the tarmac before they shut the door to the plane. I collapsed on the tarmac out of breath from the run. My flight was scheduled to leave Phoenix at 3:22 and it left at 3:17. So they not only didn\\'t they wait for me to make the connection, they left early. They could wait for people in Boise and make us all late, but left 5 minutes early and couldn\\'t wait 1 second for me in Phoenix. What absolute disrespect and disregard for their customers.   We departed PUJ approx 1/2 hour late. This reduced our connecting flight (to Dallas) time from 1 hr and 22 mins to 52 mins approx. We had to go through immigration and check our bag back and then go through security. We ended up missing the next flight to Dallas. AA staff was not helping expedite the process and then they did not give us booking into the next flight. They put us on stand by at 5 AM with no guarantee of catching that flight. They also issued two stand by tickets in my daughters name and none in my name. I caught this error after they closed the counter for the night. During this time they discouraged us from getting a hotel and sleep downstairs at the airport among the homeless people taking refuge there. Ater insisting, they told that they would give a voucher for Courtyard Marriott. But gave a voucher for Wyndham. I caught this later too. Wyndham shuttle driver did not show until 12 pm. I declined the hotel because we needed to be back at the airport by 3 AM to correct my ticket and in my naiive mind increase my chances of getting seating in the 5am flight to Dallas so that I can make the connection to San Jose California. My kids had to sleep on the seats downstairs outside of the security gates. I stayed up the whole time to secure our bags and the family. After AA counter opened, we corrected the tickets at the counter and entered the airport through security. We did not get seats in the 5AM flight. From that point on we were treated badly, dismissed, and blamed for the close timing of the connecting flights when we had no option to choose the flight route. Therefore, blaming us for missing the flight or blaming immigration for making us late. It was AA that booked the whole route for our flight. After getting the run around and getting upset. Two ladies at customer service at our insistence booked us to LA via Las Vegas because we just wanted to get out of this God forsaken airport. We got to Vegas Airport to ask for help from a supervisor at AA. She was kind enough to get us on United airlines to San Jose and told CV us that the people at Charlotte should have booked us on another airline if there was no other option and all the way to San Jose California. We were marginalized, blamed and treated inhumanely by AA across the board. The AA staff was displaying a major trip with upset passengers. One family had a toddler who was crying for 1 hour and the AA staff was numb to this family\\'s needs. The worst flight experience in my life. Even third world countries showed more respect and value for the elderly and families with children.   They charged me an additional $180 for my ticket. I was told by an agent that there was no additional fee to change flight. When I tried to check-in, I couldn\\'t. Message said call airlines. When I called after being on hold for over two hours I was told that I needed to pay an additional $180 if I wanted to fly. They outright lied to me. Do not fly with American Airlines.   This is now the second time this has happened. They are not only late to arrive, but they cram you in a super small plane, and make you sit for over an hour in the plane before even taking off. Why are you people boarding a plane that\\'s not ready to fly! Hello? How incredibly rude, so bad, terrible. I will be canceling my AA rewards, seeing as it’s constant problems with terribly small seating arrangements. Easily by far, the most horrific flight I’ve been a part of.   Very disappointed with American Airlines. Drove 10 hrs from San Francisco to catch a flight that was 2.5 hrs delayed and then 5 hrs delayed! Firstly they told that it was a traffic control and promised there will be no further delay. Then it turned out that they couldn’t find a crew for 3 am flight that’s why they postponed it till 7 am! At least make up your mind what to tell customers! American Airlines employee said to call customer service for assistance. After spending 2 hrs on hold at 3 am in the morning the lady said there’s nothing she can help me with and hang up on me! How about training you staff properly? Or it’s too much to ask?  Initial flight from SJO to MIA, easy check in. No priority channel or airline lounge so used priority pass. Flight left on time. Clean 737. Pre take off drinks offered with full bar options. Once air borne excellent cabin crew and good meal option. Short haul business/ first seat is spacious with good recline, much better than European carriers short haul product in all respects. Transit at MIA was ok. Flagship lounge of excellent quality and easy to access showers which were spacious and well maintained. Flight left on time, welcome drink was plastic clear receptacle containing warm Prosecco, this, I’m afraid is below that standard I would expect in premium cabins where champagne is expected. Once airborne, cabin crew were pleasant and helpful and delivered good meal service and food was very good. Lie flat was comfortable and slept well. Arrivals lounge at LHR was good and food options excellent. All considering a very good flight.   I would never get American Airline credit card again - what is the point of paying fees if you cannot assist me with my issue. I have been on hold twice now for 45min still cannot get anyone on the phone. I tried booking a flight with British airways, when I went online to book it with my miles it was told did not have the economy option available. Five min later I booked it through British Airways with economy. They wouldn\\'t let me use my miles on purpose. Such a shady airline. And why does it take $300 to do one hour flight from NC to FL. Found the same flight with Spirit for $52. Don\\'t book with them! If you have any issues prepare to be on hold for over an hour. I would be happy to provide screenshot of my hold time.   I booked with American Airlines because I thought it was my best bet for safe and carefree travel. I could not have been more wrong. I was going on my honeymoon to Paris, Denmark and Italy and my entire trip was RUINED because American Airlines sent my bag to London, England instead of Paris, France. You would think with a location that close they would be able to send my luggage within a day- 2 days tops, .but after the 3rd day with no email or calls, we reached out to the airlines and it was still in London. (I also had a tracker in my luggage so I could tell when it moved and where it was) This would not have been such a big deal if we were not starting our trip attending a wedding at a very expensive hotel in Paris. When my husband and I called to check on the bag, they said it would not be sent in time for the wedding so I had to scramble last minute for a \"fancy\" dress- the one I found was nothing compared to the one I bought before the trip just for the wedding. We also were leaving the next day for Demark so after a 2nd phone call the customer service representative just recommended we went my luggage home to Florida since were were going to only be in Denmark for 3 days and then travelling to Venice. He did not think they would get the luggage to me in time and we were travelling too frequently. This meant I had to buy everything from shoes, pants, underwear, makeup, hair products, medications, new luggage etc which really ruined our honeymoon because we had to take so much time buying items. I should have been enjoying my honeymoon, not worrying about buying feminine products and shoes. Then on top of that I had to worry about saving my receipts to upload to your website so I can \"possibly\" get reimbursed? Worst experience ever, I will probably never fly American Airlines again.   This was my worst experience. we arrived at Chicago late then they wouldn’t let us off the plane for an additional 10 min. Once we got off the plane we still had to wait another 5 min or so for our carry on valet bags. I got to my next boarding gate at 8:12 they. had already closed the door even though they knew the plane was late they didn’t let any of us on the flight they advised us to go to customer service and speak with them. Customer service only had flights for the minimum of a 19 hour wait. They are so inconsiderate, unprofessional and rude. The plane was tiny and hot no refreshments.   I had the absolute worst experience with AA. I flew from Sacramento to LAX on AA4929 on 3/14. Preboarding they stated there was no over bin space and my bag needed to be \\'courtesy\\' checked in. I handed over my suitcase like everyone else and expected it to be at the jet bridge. Long story short, AA informs me upon my arrival at LAX that my bag \\'must have not made it\\'.  Mine was the only bag that was left behind because \\'it must not have fit under the plane\\'. Since when is that protocol? Leave a bag behind? I have a 8 pm flight scheduled the following day. I obviously needed my bag. The AA worker stated she \\'messaged\\' the team in SAc to expedite my bag on the 8 am flight. I arrived at LAX waiting for my bag and Sacramento airport said they \\'got the message too late\\'. How does an IM message get delivered late? A new AA lady stated she would send it on the next flight but it was going to sac-phoenix arizona-lax. Then my bag gets stuck in Arizona! This same lady tells me to file a \\'late bag claim\\'. When we go online to do so, it clearly states these claims are not accepted unless your bag has been missing for 5 days? Why advise a customer to do something when they are not even able to do so? I had to pack a whole suitcase of items I bought last minute. My father did not receive my bag until Friday at 7:30 pm when I was in my seat on my way to London- a whole 24 hours late.  It was exhausting working with idiots to get my luggage that should have never been checked in in the first place - so much for the \"courtesy\\' check-in. My bag was misplaced thanks to American Airlines. I am never flying with them again.   3rd time flying this month with American and each time I\\'ve been delayed resulting in a missed connection. This time on this so called new plane gps broke after we left the gate so currently 1 hr delayed and counting. Will American try and make up for their issues, no they won\\'t they already got their fare and don\\'t care about you once you\\'ve paid.   I flew on two Eagle flights today and had a positive experience. You see: courtesy is not so difficult. And none of your stewardesses had chips on their shoulders looking to pick a fight. Just incredible. But why do you list even to-day that you are serving beverages on your flights when you\\'re not? That\\'s services not provided. I spent $7 at the airport to buy two coca colas when you can serve them onboard for 20¢ - that is discourteous.   On his trip I flew AA multiple times. Every time the flight was delayed. Monday 22 May flight 2577 PDX to DFW delayed 2 hours. Had to change to United to get to Richmond. Wednesday 2384 delayed to Charlotte. Then next flight 1848 to PDX is delayed. This is crazy. Every AA flight I have been on this week has been delayed. Never again will I book American.   American Airlines is my number one for great customer support and amazing membership awards. I fly to States almost every other month, and I choose American Airlines every time. I honestly sometimes choose them among cheaper options for the same trip. I know when I need help with my booking, they are so easy to reach and come up with a solution. They are very flexible with bookings especially in these difficult lockdown days.   I paid approx. $1100 for roundtrip flight FLL to ANC and did not want to pay additional for seating so my wife and I were assigned seats away from each other. I called the airline to change seats but the request was denied multiple times and was hung up on multiple times even though they say that the flight was half full. My flight is tomorrow 6/4/20 and I will be sitting next to my wife whether the airline approves or doesn\\'t. I will never fly American Airlines again and I would suggest that none of you do either. Good luck American Airlines - you\\'ll need it.   What a joke 6 open bag areas on the way to my seat, I paid $86 extra but they make me check my bag. I fly 2-4 times a year. American Airlines is even worse than Spirit.   It’s the disrespect for me. Shortly before boarding, we were notified that the flight was full and some bags would need to be checked. I boarded in one of the final groups and expressed that I was concerned about checking my carry on. The attendant harshly responded “idk what to tell you. Everyone here is checking their bags. All I asked politely was if any passengers already boarded were willing to check their bags. Another agent said “We can find you another flight if you don’t.” Then a different travel agent explained the policy so I could clearly understand. As soon as I was compliant upon understanding the policy, another attendant insisted I board the plane now and threatened to not allow me to travel because I responded to her rude impatience. Due to the way I was approached, I did not have time to think to get my medication that I need daily and I am on a flight until the morning. It does nothing but look bad to view customers as problematic when they are concerned about safety matters with last minute changes. As for the policy: if a single woman is traveling abroad alone, the least you can do is let her have her bag.  Will not fly again. Plane delayed - we are told because pilots coming in on another flight. Wait hours. We board - lights dimmed - flight attendants continue to get on the announcements - pilots have landed - headed to our plane. 10 minutes later - pilots have decided to deadhead - everyone off. We go to the desk - computer says weather. NO compensation. Emailed American - they proceed to tell me how weather works. I UNDERSTAND that we can\\'t control weather. What you can control is LYING. Every other plane took off. Our pilots were LATE and didn\\'t want to continue. It was STAFF - not weather. To make matters worse - we weren\\'t allowed to get our bags. They were locked. We were stuck overnight - no compensation - no bags - nothing. I flew Alaska - the next day. Never again.   Our flight to Sacramento was great (although someone needs to clean the inside windows) when we were boarding they said anyone from group 6thru 9 needed to check their bags at the gate because the flight was full. Guaranteeing that our bag will make it back home in Louisville. Our plane had 2 flight attendants. 1 did all the work while the other played on her phone and fixed her hair. we arrived in Louisville about 1230 am. And guess what. Our bag was in Dallas still.  It had our car keys in it to our car still parked at the airport. our important medicines in there as well. I realize what their disclaimer says but it has now cost us a cab ride home and now a cab ride to and from work tomorrow as well as another day to pay for our car being at the airport. Not always easy when your on a budget. When we made a claim at the airport (as well as several others) the girls response was \"I\\'m so over this \" is this the kind of people you hire? Seems to be lacking in professionalism.   We had prepaid for a seven day all inclusive trip to Puerto Vallarta. When we got up at 2:30 AM to head to the airport, I just happened to check my emails on my phone. American Airlines at 1:47 AM had sent us a notice that our flight had been postponed for one day. If I had not checked my email that early, we would have wasted several hours driving to Salt Lake and back to our home. We were able to talk the resort into extending our visit one day to make up for the lost day that the airline had caused. When we called American Airlines to move our flight back one day so we could enjoy our full week at the resort, they refused to change our return home flight plans. We lost a full day of our prepaid vacation time at the resort. When we arrived in Phoenix and went to pick up our baggage, we approached an employee and asked where we turn in our stubs to claim our baggage as per the instructions we were given in Mexico. The man said in a very rude tone, \" Just pick up your baggage and get out of the way.\"   Lexington to Charlotte. I had a truly horrible experience with AA a few weeks ago. I was flying economy, so was at the back of the plane. I asked if this could be changed because I have a migraine disability and being near the engine noise exacerbates this condition. I was told no at ticketing, but told it could be possible at the gate. My father\\'s funeral was the previous day, and I was with my son, so I forgot about asking at the gate. once I got on the plane, I tried to speak with the stewardess about the situation. I have never been treated so aggressively rudely in my life. She made it very clear that I was a nuisance from the beginning. We ended up stuck on the runway for two hours because it was Sunday and they had to call in a crew (they weren\\'t already at the airport) to remove a plane blocking the runway with a flat tire. I tried to explain to the stewardess about my disability and asked if I could sit in one of the many empty seats at the front, in order to alleviate the extra noise and heat of sitting in the back--triggers for the disease. She yelled at me, created a scene, refused to respond when I pushed the overhead button so that I could get rid of the needle and syringe I had to use because of the stress her behavior caused me. After two hours of sitting on the tarmac, we taxied back to the gate and I was removed for being \"disruptive\". I couldn\\'t believe it! Because of this aggressive, nasty, devoid-of-compassion stewardess, I was seven extra hours en-route to my destination! When I complained to the airlines, they basically said \"too bad\". If the stewardess doesn\\'t like you, they can label you \"disruptive\" and have you removed! Was she taking something out on me? Was it bad day for her (consider my situation with my father)? I have no idea, and the Airlines refused to take responsibility! I will do my utmost never to fly with company again because of this women. It was horrible!   Worst airline I\\'ve ever made the mistake of booking a ticket through. Flight after flight cancelled & delayed. Never booking a flight through them again! Dont recommend unless you want to have a couple day stay at the airport and don\\'t have anything to do or place to be. Thanks for the huge inconvenience waste of time and money I am extremely upset!   After a 6 hour drive to the airport our flight was cancelled. They gave me the option of taking another flight later however they could not guarantee me seats next to my 4 children under the age of 12. To say poor quality of service would be an understatement! Absolutely do not recommend American Airlines!   Orlando to Washington. Never flying American again. These are the rudest people I’ve ever met. My bag fit perfectly in the measuring thing. They lady came took it out and put it back still fit then was like look check the bag or you\\'re not flying. I told her I don’t have time to wait for baggage claim.   First off I wanted to start with saying I rarely or never use AA and I do not foresee myself, my family or my employees using AA again. original booking Oct 2020 flights were changed twice and had to reschedule vacation, outgoing SLC - OGG added 5 hrs to my trip. OGG - SLC was delayed several times, multiple gate changes without notice, arrival was late to SLC, landed at 8:07PM Bags scanned and offloaded at 8:20 PM bags did not make the SLC Carousel until 10:15 PM, no updates nothing. I contacted AA baggage in airport and he shrugged it off as oh well just wait. Then I called Customer Service 800 # for AA and she was very unhelpful. Multiple airlines baggage come and went while all passengers from AA2999 stood around not getting answers. With the increased fares, additional baggage charges and wasted time from delayed and/or forced changes to itineraries, I find it appalling that the customer service is this bad, only forcing me to not make changes from Delta or United Airlines, I would rather book with Frontier, Southwest or Alaskan Airlines than have to go through this again. I will be sending a certified letter to the board of directors, I am a Million Mile client with Delta. Shame on me for trying to use another airline that is not capable of offering the same great service as their counterparts.   I paid $977 for a round trip flight from Houston, Tx to Peoria,  they don\\'t even offer a free checked back and have the nerve to have the wrong measurements for carry ones knowing your going to be flying the smallest plane when going to a smaller city. The AA measurements for a carry-on bag is not correct and they know it which makes customers be forced to pay for a checked bag! I had one personal item in a carry-on that i know for a fact was measured correctly because i got the brand and also the measurements for the bag to make sure it was in fact able to be carried as a carry on. Iarrive early to the airport to make sure it was indeed the correct size and got my boarding pass an went on through security i get to board my plane an your flight attendant tells me its too big when one of your workers before even going through security measured it told me it was the correct size. Then the attendant stated were on a smaller plane. I had to pay $60 more dollars to check my bag that was the correct size because you want to fly small planes and your measurement stand that you have you know is not correct for the sizes that you state on your website. On my flight home after paying over $1000 to fly  I couldn\\'t even use the restroom because it was out of order so for 35mins.   It first started at the curbside check in. I waited 20 minutes for this one customer service rep helping a family family. I had been in line a long time and asked him is it going to take much longer, he seemed to not understand English and waved me off.. I say this because the family he was hoping he was speaking Spanish to. Anyway, I get out of the line and go to another and my bag is checked. After we boarded the flight we sat on the plane for about 35 minutes or so before the captain came on to tell us there was an issue with the smoke detector and we were waiting for the maintenance people to arrive. They apparently arrived at some point as we sat on the plane that was getting hotter by the minute with no info. Finally, roughly 45 minutes later he came on and said that they\\'re trying to fix it but they didn\\'t understand what was going on.. The maintenance people don\\'t have a clue. Great! After about 2 hrs they tell us that the plane is being taken out of service & we have to deplane ... so now everyone has to get off, take all of their luggage out of the overhead cabins and go sit and wait in the boarding area again.. Mind you there are people on the flight whose final destination was not Los Angeles and they were going on to Portland and Hawaii. American got on the intercom and told them they were completely sold out, they didn\\'t have any other flights to put them on and if they didn\\'t get to LA on time most of them will be looking at spending the night in the airport. So now after waiting in the boarding area again they tell us that they repaired the problem and we\\'re going to start the boarding process all over again. About an hour later we\\'re all back on the plane but we sit there another 30 minutes before we\\'re ever pushed back. The pilots weren\\'t very informative ... they let us sit there quite a while before they told us that the holdup was that we were number 8 in line to take off and there was some weather pattern that was delaying all of the takeoffs. 4 1/2 hours later we finally get in the air and the trip itself is uneventful except for the screaming baby..We were supposed to land at 1:05 but we landed at 5:15. Then the flight attendant gets on the intercom and tells us we\\'re going to have to go into a satellite gate and take a bus. It only made sense, the entire flight had been a comedy of errors. A few minutes later she gets on and says we\\'re not going to the satellite location but we are going to pull up at the gate in the international terminal. But before that, once again we\\'re sitting on the aircraft wondering what\\'s going on and the pilot gets on and tells us ladies and gentlemen the machine or whatever it is they used to bring the plane and attach it to the jetway is for the wrong type of aircraft & we have to wait for them to go get the right one. So finally we had to get off the plane and walk all the way over to the domestic travel area to retrieve our luggage and the poor people trying to make connecting flights had a long way to get there because they weren\\'t even in the domestic terminal. Finally, because of the plane being in the international travel terminal and the luggage coming through the domestic side, we waited 30 minutes before they even started sending the luggage down. For the privilege of all of this, we got water a soda and a ginger cookie. I fly a lot and this was the absolute worst flight of my entire life.   1 minute! They shut the door over 1 minute? The connecting flight had 2 of us there and they wouldn\\'t let us in as we then watched for 30 minutes the plane just sit there. 1 minute ruined a perfect vacation. 1 minute separated me from my family on the plane. 1 minute ruined the rest of the day for all of us. When the people are still putting their bags up and there is someone trying to get past the double doors, your policy sucks!   I don\\'t think I could give less of a review. My son was traveling as an unaccompanied minor today. He had a connection flight and they gave his seat away to someone on standby. I was never notified! I spent hours trying to find where my son was, went to my local airport to find he was still in his connection city. Not given an update as to what flight he was being put on or departure time they let me talk to him but no one from American Airlines would get on the phone with me. I\\'ve been on hold for 8 hours trying to speak to someone in customer service and still cannot connect with anyone. I was told by my local airport the next flight they\\'re putting him on may get canceled but it\\'s the last flight out for the day. I asked what happens to my son overnight and am told they don\\'t know I\\'ll have to talk to someone in customer service about that! The same customer service that I\\'ve been on hold with. I don\\'t even have the words to express what they have put me through and not the local airport or Charlotte Airport American Airlines staff seem to care I didn\\'t know where my son was or what flight he was on. They see nothing wrong in the fact they never notified me they gave his seat away and put him on a different flight. Do not trust your loved ones with this airline   We flew out of FAR on 10/3. We had a 6:20am flight with a 1.5 layover in Dallas for our connecting flight to Puerto Vallarta. The American Airlines gate had one employee. This employee was doing tickets, baggage, incoming flights and she even left to flag in an incoming plane. There were about 20 people in our line when we arrived at 5:45AM. We stood in that short line for nearly an hour to get checked in. Once checked in, we waited for boarding for about 30 minutes. We did not taxi off until just after 8AM. That was 1.5 hours past our scheduled flight times. This late departure caused us to miss our connection in Dallas to Puerto Vallarta. No one seemed to care! That was the only flight. When we arrived at the ticket counter to find out what we now do, we were told there are other flights. When we asked about hotels, she proceeded to tell us it was up to us to figure that out. They were not late due to maintenance and therefore no assistance. After much discussion, they gave us $12 food vouchers and a room at a local hotel that was very nasty. The next morning we flew out as scheduled. On our return flight back to the States, we had a 1.5 hour layover in Dallas again prior to our final flight to Fargo. Customs took 1 hour of that layover. We literally ran to our connecting flight only to find the door locked. We banged on the window to get someone\\'s attention. They let us in, but the couple who we were traveling with were just 2 minutes behind us. We told them they were coming, but they did not care. They text us while we were just getting seated to let us know they are at the end of the jetway. We told the attendants, but they said they cannot do anything about it. The plane left without them. Such terrible customer service! We arrive in Fargo to find that our luggage didnt make it. We complete a text that was sent to us to notify them we want our luggage delivered to our home as the text offered. It has been over 24 hours and still no luggage. I called the toll free number to see why, they said we are not set up as delivery. I gave her my confirmation code, but apparently, that didn\\'t matter. On all flights, the planes were at either full capacity or within 90% of capacity. No social distancing going on in those vessels. Proper mask wear was not enforced. The guy next to me had his nose exposed and coughed from Dallas to Fargo. I had to ask him to cover up. The flight attendants walked by several times and didn\\'t even notice. Never again will I fly American Airlines.   I booked and paid for tickets for our family for a once in a lifetime trip to Belize. Our flight on June 18 was canceled due to staffing issues. It was rebooked for June 20 but canceled again due to staffing issues. They tried to rebook us for June 22 but by this point we would only have 3 days of our 7 day vacation in Belize. As a result of American Airlines, we lost $12,000 in hotel, excursions and local Belize flights! To make it worse, they will not refund my tickets, they want to offer flight credits. My family will never be able to use these credits in the next 10 months. They ruined our vacation, cost me $18,000 and won’t even speak to me live on the phone. Their customer service department does not speak to customers. You are forced to communicate via email. This is the worst airline company on the planet!  Greensboro to Charlotte. Terminal staff were very diligent about reminding passengers to wear masks and to social distance. However there was no social distancing on the flight. Not one seat around me was vacant. Very unhappy and concerned of the health risk due to COVID19. I work in a hospital and feel better protected there. I would have expected better from American Airlines.   Recently, my wife and I flew from Orlando to Seattle, with a layover in Phoenix, during the holiday season. We faced several issues that significantly impacted our journey, leading to disappointment with American Airlines. Flight Delay and Layover Missed: Initially informed in Orlando about a delay due to mechanical issues, we understood these things happen. However, this delay caused us to miss our connecting flight in Phoenix.  Miscommunication at the Counter: The representative in Orlando hastily rebooked us on the next morning’s flight. Despite our inquiries about alternative flights, even at our own additional expense, we were assured unnecessary and guaranteed seats on the next flight. This turned out to be misleading. Standby Tickets Without Notice: At our gate, we discovered our Phoenix to Seattle tickets were actually on standby - a critical detail omitted by the staff. When we called American Airlines, we were informed we were 17th in line on the standby list.  Altered Travel Plans and Additional Expenses: Our original arrival in Seattle was scheduled for 3 AM on December 23. Due to these changes, not only was our arrival delayed to 10 AM, but with the standby status, we wouldn’t depart from Phoenix until 3:20 PM. This forced us to incur unexpected hotel expenses.  Unacknowledged Paid Seat Upgrades: We had paid an extra $100 for better seats for our Phoenix to Seattle flight. Given our standby status, this seems like an expense unlikely to be refunded.  Lack of Transparency and Assistance: The situation was exacerbated by a lack of honest communication from the beginning. When explaining our situation, the response from American Airlines was unhelpful, offering no compensation, such as a food voucher, or a genuine apology.  Final Decision: This experience has profoundly affected our view of American Airlines. Despite my wife’s cousin being a pilot for the airline, we are deeply disappointed. We expected more from an airline with a history of poor reviews. The lack of customer service and poor communication has led us to decide against using American Airlines in the future, regardless of cost.   Fargo to Dallas via San Diego. We had the worst travel experience. Rushed to get on plane to miss thunder storm to still land at a different airport due to needing fuel, so we had to wait out thunderstorms, which lead us to miss our flight to SD. 1 expense we shouldn\\'t have had Hotel and a very expensive uber that night/ morning. Get to SD no luggage. Luggage showed up almost 12 hours later and my suitcase was destroyed. They delivered it, they know the condition but once got home after vacation was told I needed to report within 24 hours. I was on vacation, the last thing I want to deal with. Bought a new one. My clothes were wet and some dirty. On the Way back, Fargo was having a Blizzard so understand delay, got rebooked for next morn, for them to change the time at least 4 times to end up cancelling and saying due to weather and the Fargo airport was closed. Big fat lie. Went to book for Sunday, no flights. We then had to buy tickets with another airline to get home Sunday night. In which we were to be hone Friday night. So 2 more nights of hotel and food not reimbursed for. And husband missing Mon of work as he works out of town. Never again we will fly AA.   AA 1289 was scheduled to depart JFK for BDA at 7:05 am on July 3. Some of the vacationers, many with small children, got up at 3am to catch this flight. We finally departed after 9 pm — after more than 14 hours, with no explanation, no apologies and no recompense. There were several aborted reschedulings in the interim. At one of them, the flight crew actually boarded, only to deplane 20 minutes later. They explained to the anxious crowd around the podium that there was a maintenance problem with the auxiliary power unit. So, during one of the busiest travel times of the year, at one of AA’s principal hubs, they didn’t have the wherewithal — parts and/or expertise — to make this repair. In other words, this terrible experience was 100% due to AA’s incompetence. Meanwhile, we got closer and closer in time to predicted, severe thunderstorms, raising the suspicion that AA was hoping nature would let them off the hook for canceling the flight. Finally, AA put us on substitute equipment, 3 hours after it arrived from CLT. I’ve been flying AA for 50 years and have 1.6 million miles. This was the worst customer service fiasco in that span.   Worst experience for a first time flyer. I booked flight early and didn\\'t get to my destination on time. The plane broke down and it was several hours later before we got to Charlotte from RDU. And American airlines stated they couldn\\'t do anything to compensate me for not being able to get me to my destination on time. Very disappointed and will choose another airline in the future. Unbelievable. And they supposed to had provided pretzels and water. That wasn\\'t provided at all. No TV on no plane and the wifi I couldn\\'t use.  We had our flight diverted from Charlotte to Greensboro. This would not be an issue however American refused to comp hotel, food, or reasonable rebooking and I am stuck in Charlotte for 24 hours. The lack of respect at 2 am from most service representatives spoken too was disheartening. I would not fly American again due to this experience when given the option.   I guess this airline forgot about social distances. My return flight is with American Airlines and I’ll be change it.  First and last time flying with this Airline. I’m to upset we are not 6ft social distances. Also they mess me and my husband tickets up he sitting 10 rows ahead of me, and I booked together.   The worst flight experience ever! They do not care about their customers. Flight canceled because they didn’t have the crew to fly the plane, if you know there is a pilot shortage why book these flights? Then they had the audacity to book us (my 3 children and I a flight for two days later out of San Diego this is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. I will make it my responsibility not to ever fly with American again. My refund won’t take place until 2 weeks if then. I was instructed to keep checking back until it’s completed because they are back logged on refunds. I wonder why?   The flight from Boston to Indianapolis with my partner was not bad, but come back was just miserable all around. I have had several bad experiences with American Airlines on both domestic and international flights in the past; old, dirty planes, lack of any inflight entertainment (other than old drop down ancient TVs from what-appears-to-be from the 1960s), inadequate leg room, etc. But the last few times I have flown with them, it was not too bad and the planes were better; cleaner, etc. but I had one of those experiences again! It was like going back to 2011, 2012 with American! Not only was the plane my partner and I flew this time around; both on the flight to and from, old and decrepit (relatively clean, but extremely dated), there was hardly any legroom whatsoever.  This journey was made even more miserable because one of the flight attendants in the back of the plane was rude and dismissive when I had to get up and use the restroom. She told me to \"sit down because of turbulence\". There was no turbulence at that point. It got to the point where I waved up to another flight attendant at the front of the plane if I could use the restroom up there and he was very friendly and understanding and said I could \"but to make it quick before the turbulence\" and sure enough I was able to do so (it was also an emergency). He was so nice, and I was able to sit back down before the turbulence (which got pretty bad at one point), but the other female flight crew member denying me access to the restroom when there was not any turbulence at one point was rude and unprofessional. I will do everything in my will power to avoid American Airlines at all costs going forward.  Plane was old, dirty (sticky armrest, finger prints all over the window, tray dirty, etc.) Inflight service was almost non-existent, we had to ask for a glass of water after being skipped over and had to take our own trash off the plane. Paid for an upgrade and received absolutely zero benefit. Will probably not fly this airline in the future.   I had a rather unpleasant experience with this airline. One simple cancellation, due to a storm, and their Charlotte hub information desk was understaffed and hopelessly overcrowded with stressed customers. I waited my turn, for nearly two hours, to ask whether they could provide any accommodation, and they turned me down. My online request was met with indifference. Not okay, AA, it was a mistake trying you.   Let me begin by saying if I could give them negative stars I would. I just had the worst experience of my life on an airline not once, but twice. On my way to Dallas this past Wednesday, I was deplaned twice for broken planes. The first one had a bad fuel pump. The second one blew a bunch of fuses. Then I wait for hours at the airport for a plane from Chicago. My flight was supposed to take off at 3.48 pm. It didn\\'t take off until after 9.00 pm. I didn\\'t arrive in Dallas until after midnight. I missed an entire first day of meetings for work because of it. Then, the return flight back to Fort Wayne was again a mess. We were deplaned again for mechanical issues. This flight was supposed to take off at 6.40 pm. We boarded the plane at 8.30 pm then sat while they deiced this new plane for over an hour. We didn\\'t take off until almost 10.00 pm. I was supposed to land in Fort Wayne at 10.10 pm. I didn\\'t get there until after midnight. I will never ever fly American again!   I was kicked off a flight for making a snap chat video. When I was told to delete it I did and on top of that I took it a step further to show them my story and my personal pictures that I did not have video. The flight attendant left and I thought that was the end of it. The flight attendant complained after I complemented her and claimed I was drunk to get me kicked off the plane. I was not drunk and I was very polite and very sober. Does not matter. They turned the plane around, had 3 personnel escort me off the flight and told me it’s my fault even though the manager admitted he wasn’t there and doesn’t know the story. I was compliant and didn’t argue and was very quiet bc I needed to get home. I’m now pushed to a different flight and the costs to babysitting and my life went up $500 just bc some flight attendant didn’t like me. I’m not sure how to act on a plane these days.   Grand Rapids to Chicago. This airline is not for their customers, or the military. They will make false promises and scam you out of your money. If you fly with them, get insurance on your tickets. They have no customer service, and those you may speak with are rude, demeaning, impatient, and do not want to help you. This has been the case for my last several flights. Additionally, they work on their time, not yours. Do not expect any information, or to make a flight, if you have to depend on their assistance.  Charleston to Pittsburgh via Washington. Enjoying an extra long stay at Reagan International Airport (DCA) of American Airlines lack of communication with connecting flights! 2nd time American Airlines messed up our trip in 2 months. Highly recommend using another airline! Southwest Airlines and Jet Blue have been getting hit lately. Wanted to put things in perspective. We were there 20 minutes before departure after connecting flight from Pittsburgh. They closed door 5 min early while we walked up because not in waiting room. Other AA gate customer service said \"we cannot help you. We are boarding our flight.\" The previous trip to St Thomas they charged me extra for premium boarding but had oversold. They got me on only flight of day 10 minutes before depart  This flight crew were extremely rude and disgusting, rarely smiled and made ignorant remarks. The airline should be ashamed of themselves, and reconsidering their hiring qualifications because having patient and understanding staff is crucial when it comes to being 35,000 in the air. Flying can already bring enough anxiety, and it’s too expensive to be dealing with ill-mannered staff who provoke even more anxiety, there are too many other airlines to use this, never again. Don’t make our same mistake, it is just not worth it. I fly multiple times a year, it’s always the same with American and I’ve finally had enough to write a review, hopefully it can help someone.   Rochester to Nashville via Philadelphia. American Airline employees were outstanding during our trip. We requested assistance for my mother who uses a walker and were happily surprised at the level of attentiveness and promptness received. We have flown United and Delta with identical service requests and have always had to wait for a wheelchair transfer between gates, even so much as having to find our own wheelchair. From ticketing to boarding and transfers an American employee was there. To top off this trip when we arrived at our final destination the brake handle on the walker had been accidentally broken. We went to baggage services and were provided with a brand new walker (same model). This was more than we expected. I was only hoping to receive a replacement part. American Airlines has gone over and above with customer service. If you need travel assistance I highly recommend American. The American Airlines employees we encountered were trained properly and should be recognized.   This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. They should not even be in business. They never leave on time, the pilots work on they own their time. It is just frustrating with this company because they don’t take off until an hour after departure. I hate this airline.   Shreveport to Dallas-Fort Worth. I will never fly with this airline again. Take off from Shreveport was delayed for weather, which is fine, we arrived to Dallas at 5:50 pm. My connecting flight was scheduled to take off at 6:34, so I figured this was the perfect amount of time to get to my next gate, I was wrong. We weren’t let off the airplane until 6:30 because a plane was disabled at the gate we needed to get to. Missed my connecting flight and it was 100% the fault of the airline. Wasn’t provided with any hotel room or accommodations (the next flight they could put me on was 11 am the next morning); told they couldn’t do anything because it was put in the system that everything was weather related, which was completely false, it was because there was an airplane at our gate. No emotion from employees, they didn\\'t care.   We had a flight to Miami where the city of Miami shut down our event due to Coronavirus. Our flight to Miami was with United Airlines, they were beyond understanding and helped us get a full refund. Unfortunately, our return trip was with American Airlines who doesn\\'t care about their customers well being. Because the flight hasn\\'t been cancelled they don\\'t think that customers well-being is at risk and are refusing to give refunds. American airlines released a statement saying this, \"On every journey you take with American Airlines, your safety and well-being, and that of our team members, is our top priority.\" this is a straight up lie if they aren\\'t willing to work with  customers in a national health emergency like other airlines. They will never be getting our business again and I advise everyone to stay away from such an abhorrent company who only cares about themselves.   We were delayed over an hour because of lack of crew members so we the passengers had to wait until there were enough crew members so we can began boarding. So we were at the mercy of them. Why did the airline scheduled a fly if they don’t have enough people on their staff? I lost not only time but meetings I had to attend upon my arrival to my destination. I will never fly on this airplane ever again. If I you plan to use this airline; by a ticket for an early fly because you will depart within 2 or 3 hours delay. If you have a connection fly, good luck! American will not reimburse you for acquiring another ticket at extra charge.   I have not yet boarded the plane, however, this was my worst experience ever flying. The person at the check in for American Airlines was horrible. After I had stood in line for about 20 minutes, I was told that I would have to go back to the self service machines to get tags for my bags. I expressed that I was not aware that I was supposed to have stopped to get tags. He then verbalized that that is what I needed to do and then I would have to stand in the line again. I went back to the machine that he referred me to, and it requested a representative for confirmation. He then refused to check me in, and stated he would talk to my husband, but not me. I have been flying for many, many years and have never been treated in this manner. A few minutes after Mr X refused to assist me another group came to the desk to another person at the desk who and allowed them to come through the line. They had also not gotten the tags from the machine. I am very reluctant to say how I feel, however I would be happy to speak to someone from American Airlines regarding this unfortunate situation. I would love to discuss this further.  $30 for checked bag, $3 for curbside service, $100 dollars for bag 12 pounds over. And that\\'s one way. What a racket. Going back to Jetblue.   First off I agree I could’ve better planned on my end. But I spent 10 hours at the airport to basically find my own solution. 3 visits to the customer service line and 2 phone calls before I decided this is ridiculous. My first flight out I missed by 5 mins even though I watched them give other stand by people my seat. There was a bad storm that delayed everyone. I was put on stand by 3 times before I’m like no this can not be the solution. My 3rd visit to customer service was met with limited reps and basically the last rep showing no empathy after I’ve been running around the entire airport for 7 hours just to get oh no the flight is overbooked. I ended up just purchasing a new ticket through JetBlue and let my anxiety not get the best of me. The reason I missed my flight is because pre-check took 40 mins to get through. No one had a sense of urgency. 10 people missed my flight so don’t you think that’s a big issue. I get it if it was only me but 10. The same people running from flight to flight. American wanted to wait on standby until the next day. I\\'m on a business trip for work there is no next business day. I\\'m just upset that it took so much time waiting to get no resolution and then me deciding to take my fate into my own hand where it got resolved. I will be calling American to get a travel credit after the amount they screwed me over. I’ll better plan my trip next time but American get better and treat your customers right. There was over 50 standby at one point. Y’all need to think of a better solution.   American Airlines understand nothing about time. The flight can get delayed 3 times just because the flight attendant doesn’t have a proper time management. Extremely unprofessional. And of course they won’t credit you for wasting your time.   American Airlines is one of the worst companies I have had experiences with that I’ve ever had. They delayed my flight to Europe, causing me to miss my connecting flight. I am understanding that things happen sometimes but the way they handled it was unacceptable. I was traveling with my entire family and small child and they totally displaced us causing a domino effect of chaos for our travels to a foreign country that we have planned for 10 years. It was very unprofessional way that they handled the situation, and they were just dumped me off to the next supervisor who would then dump me off to another supervisor. You’re unwilling to give me any type of compensation for the chaos that they created and that’s just unreasonable in my opinion and unprofessional in business. If you and your family like getting treated like trash, then I would highly recommend them but if you don’t, I would run\\xa0for\\xa0the\\xa0hills.   The absolute worst airline in existence. My family and I took a trip to California for the first time, the flight there connected to Charlotte wasn’t too bad, although it was delayed both times. The flight back was terrible. First flight to Charlotte was delayed. We finally get on the plane and it’s cutting it way too close to our departure time for the connecting flight. We sprinted to the gate and made it to minutes before the departure time and it said the flight was closed. Several other people from my flight were also there and missed the flight. It was American Airline’s fault in the first place that we were delayed and they had no care in the world for the connecting flight. No talk of accommodations, refunds, or anything. Next flight isn’t until 9am the next morning from Charlotte to Richmond, meaning we would have to stay overnight in the airport. Worst airline ever, do not recommend as they do NOT care about their customers and do not accommodate or help out even when it’s their fault.   Puerto Vallarta to Austin was as good as a short haul flight gets. Friendly, professional check in, new aircraft, very comfortable seat in Economy, plenty of plugs and chargers that actually worked, flight on time, friendly service, not too long wait for luggage. A very pleasant experience overall.   American Airlines kept delaying my flight to New Orleans where I was meeting family flying in from another state as well. My flight was delayed for 5.5 hours. When asked what the problem was, no one knew and no one cared. They also kept changing my departure gate and ended up going to another terminal. The flight attendant on the last leg of my flight to New Orleans was rude and snarky. This was my first and last trip with American Airlines.   Why did I not hear all the stories of terrible customer service, rude employees, and mistreatment before I booked 12 of us to travel to Guatemala for a week to serve in third-world poverty? We will gladly pay the $200/person we thought we were saving by going with American next time. After being delayed several times for Flight 1027 at 6:03 pm with almost no communication except for online updates, they finally boarded us at 10 PM. We sat on the runway and the pilot gave us updates every 20 minutes or so that we were waiting for enough fuel should we need to reroute to another airport. He was clearly growing more frustrated and told us he had \"called Dallas\" to try to get fuel. (We didn\\'t know if Dallas was a person or place, but now know it\\'s the headquarters.) At just after midnight the pilot informed us that we still hadn\\'t gotten the fuel delivery and told us, \"I am leaving this flight, someone will tell you what will happen next.\" First, a delay to 3:00 AM popped up for a minute and then changed to 5 AM departure. By the time we were deboarded, thanks to the efficient and friendly flight crew (the only highlight) it was after 12:30 AM. They told us to get in line for a free hotel voucher or meal voucher ($12). The hotel voucher offer was pretty useless since we would have to return to the airport 2+ hours before the flight and it was already 1 AM. How much sleep would we have gotten after waiting in line, waiting for a hotel shuttle, checking into the hotel, and then getting the shuttle in time for the morning at 3:00 AM? We slept on the disgusting Miami International Airport floor with dozens of others, freezing from the AC. (They forced us to gate-check our carry-ons so most of us were in t-shirts.) Wait, there\\'s more! At about 4:15 AM when boarding was supposed to begin and everyone was crowded around, an apologetic gate agent announced, \"Ladies and gentlemen, I know you are expecting to leave at 5 but I am here to tell you that is not going to happen.\" He explained he had a pilot available but no cabin crew. (Mismanagement again with false promises.) American finally got us off the ground at around 9 (I am foggy on this detail, exhausted). When we arrived in Guatemala we were unable to keep our original plans. Instead of driving to our remote destination where we planned to begin work a few hours before we had to get lodging in the city to get some sleep rather than begin exhausted. Of course, I reached out to American Airlines Customer Service requesting some form of compensation for the mismanagement, lack of communication, and mistreatment during this flight. This was not an understandable weather event or mechanical problem. \"Please accept my sincere apologies for the experience you\\'ve described,\" was the scripted reply. Unfortunately, American Airlines caused us expenses that could have been used to benefit the people we went to help. My advice after hearing from others telling similar stories? Spend the extra money to avoid flying American Airlines. (We\\'ll also be avoiding the dumpy Miami International Airport. It is badly in need of renovations.)   Fails on multiple accounts. Twenty minutes before boarding my first flight, I received notifications that my connecting flight was completely cancelled. No offer of explanation or reason and only the automated, \"We are working to resolve this\" statement. Only had available options for new flights, which were limited due to the fact that it was going to a very small airport with only one way in, therefore a known limited dependence on their airline. When I, myself, found another flight that would have gotten me to a nearby airport and presented to that gate in another terminal just as they were about to close, the representative at the gate denied my boarding, even though there was space, because, \"I did not have any visible interruptions on my record via the record locator\" because I had reflexively chosen the first available new flight option to have something  on the agenda. All that despite the multiple texts, emails, notification of the clear cancellation of my connecting arriving flight. 3After I was able to find an equivalent of this second alternative route with a pleasant LAX AA customer rep via United Airlines, both he and the United airlines rep reported that I still had my return flights. However, the next day when i was checking status of the flights, they no longer appeared, and I was no longer on those flights, I suspect due to the fact that I was never cancelled from my original flights and as I did not board those, it cancelled my returns. This was all discovered 6.5 hours prior to departure.  Even after I called and had those return flights rebooked under me, I had to ask the rep to check on the status, and only then did she relay that the outgoing first leg was already found to be delayed to arrive at my connecting airport 30-40 minutes after the connecting leg was supposed to takeoff, prompting to find ANOTHER alternative route, causing me to leave for home 5 hours earlier than expected for an already short trip. Because of all these changes, I have had the extra expense of finding a last minute rental car, as the alternative airport was 95 miles away, and the corresponding gas. Then I had to change the rental return last minute. Again, still no courtesy to explain why I was heavily inconvenienced at all in the first place. No offer to proactively help other than the automated, \"Here are alternative flights\". If I had not been proactive, I would have flown out of my original airport and gotten stuck at the layover for over 12 hrs, and arrived at my destination with less than 24hrs to spend. And THEN would have been forced to be delayed at my second layover, causing me to be late for work Monday morning. Will never fly with American again. Absolutely horrible experience and no remorse whatsoever. I have travelled on many airlines and am very accustomed to policies and procedures, but this was unacceptable. Thankfully I was travelling alone with one carry-on, due to the already short nature of the trip, but if I was going for work, or with my kids, or with a checked-in luggage, this would have been 10x more horrible.    Terrible company, cannot emphasize this enough. Complete waste of time and money. Vacation ruined. Plane was late, staff is rude, plane is dirty. Plane was too late for connecting flight, compensation? Nothing. My next flight is full so I’m out of luck. Terrible company. Do not use.   The worst airline I\\'ve ever used. My flight got cancelled due to COVID-19 and I tried to get a refund but the agents were rude, and at every step of the way I had to argue with them for my right to a refund. They made it extremely difficult for me. I am a student and I can\\'t afford to have money stolen from me like this.   We didn’t have any issues with flight delays. We had to fly to LA first and than to Hawaii. Seats weren’t too bad, there was a charging port at each seat and enough leg room where you didn’t feel too cramped. I think everyone should get a whole can or water bottle, do away with the cups but besides that it was good. The flight from LA to Hawaii was kind of fun because the flight attendants were in Hawaii clothes and seemed excited to be flying us there. I would fly with them again.  Denver to Chicago. Flight attendants were absolutely horrible. They were extremely rude and not the least bit helpful. My family and I will never fly with American Airlines again. I do not condone disrespect.  We were told in the terminal that all overhead bins were full and we would need to check our bags. We get in the plane and there were many spaces in the overhead bins, several were actually totally empty and their doors closed still empty at take off. This is totally ridiculous! We got in the plane and mentioned it to the flight attendants and they said it did not come from them! So how does this happen? Waiting for my bag will probably make me late for my appointment in Boston!   Flight attendants went out of their way to be extremely rude to passengers, did not help with a single thing. I had to help the gentlemen next to me after he had asked the flight attendant for help, and she said “I don’t sit in these seats you need to figure it out yourself.” Terrible and disgusting behavior. One gentleman asked about a meal, and the attendants proceeded to laugh at him. Never would have imagined this type of service. I will never be traveling with American Airlines again.   American Airlines = cancelled flights, delays, rough landing. Take them if you need to miss your appointment. At least changing cancelled flights is free. 1st carry on, too.   Charlotte to San Francisco. American Airlines caused me to stay at the airport overnight to wait for the next flight. My first flight to LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) was delayed multiple times, totaling 1 hour of wait. Then, the plane take off was delayed by 30 minutes. All of this made my connection to SFO tighter. When we landed, I had a 30 minute window to catch the connection, but then there was another 1 hour long wait inside the plane which was supposedly going to be \"5 minutes\" according to the pilot. Even more, after I flew and got off the second, rescheduled flight, I found out my bag was put in another plane arriving in SFO at a later time, which meant 2 hours of bag delay. All these troubles totally messed up my arrival schedule and plans, and I lost my trust on American Airlines (AA) as this is the second time it is happening. The previous one was an international flight on August 31, 2019. For the travelers out there, I recommend looking for other airline options.   So many things wrong, but here are my to 2. 1) I got an update at 6 am before my flight that my terminal had changed at Punta Cana, it hadn\\'t. I almost missed my flight. And 2) The flight from Punta Cana landed today September 3rd at 11.32am, my next flight to Boston? At 9.30pm! Almost 10 hour layover. In the future I\\'m not flying with AA ever again.   We were supposed to fly out of Wichita airport to Dallas on August 2nd 2021. Less than 12 hours before our flight the app showed our flight was cancelled, we left Wichita in hopes to make our connecting flight in Dallas, called customer service and we were on hold for the whole drive (total of 5 hours) stood in the line for customer service at Dallas airport for 2 hours for them to tell us that they sold our seats. They told us how we could’ve solved this was if we had called customer service and told them to hold our seats, we explained to them that we were on hold with them our whole drive from Wichita. They found a flight for us the next day which we accepted, we had to retest for COVID because it would no longer be within the 72 hours required to land in Hawaii. While sitting to get tested, the app showed our flight was cancelled again. We went to the airport again and could not find another flight to get us to Hawaii in enough time to participate in things we had scheduled, not to mention we would have been cutting our vacation almost in half. This was supposed to be my first ever flight, and I am nothing but disappointed in American Airlines, their customer service is anything but helpful, and in no way are they dependable. I will not use them again.   Absolutely worst experience ever! My parents are seniors who can\\'t speak English. When I asked for a gate pass so I can escort my parents through the TSA to their boarding gate, the AA staff absolutely refused to give me one. I have always been able to get one with other airlines and the AA website stated I could. The AA staff acted like I was an idiot and their explanation for it was because of \"security concern\" and even told me to just give my parents the instructions. How do you give someone instructions in another language and expect them to follow through in a huge international airport where there is no other language but English? The TSA officer couldn\\'t understand why they refused to give me one either. If not for the kind TSA who took her time to help my parents get to their gate after 1 failed attempt, I don\\'t think my parents would have made it to the gate on time. I have left them a message to call me back and discuss this issue.   This is horrendous - the plane is completely full despite being told they were only selling a portion of their flights during COVID-19. We are jam packed in here and they still didn’t even consider loading the plane rear to front in order to minimize the flow of people walking past each other. I am appalled that the airline behaves this way and if it wasn’t important that I board this flight I would have walked away. This is disgusting and shows the true colors of such an airline. You say you care about passenger health and wellness (let alone that of your staff!) and you pack us all in here. Reckless and disgusting. I will never fly American again - pandemic or not.  This is the worst airline I have ever entered. They moved my husband’s flight from 3:40 pm to 7 am and did not even send an email or anything to inform him. He had to cancel and fly another airline. They moved my flight from 3:40 pm to 7:49 pm. They kept on moving it without any apologies. They moved my terminal and I had to walk all over the airport just to get to my gate. I tried to complain to customer care but they were so rude. I almost felt like crying. Going back from Seattle to Dallas, they moved my flight from 7:17 to 5 am without any notice. Thankfully, I checked my email and saw it. I have flown on bad airlines but American takes the cake. It is one of the worst experiences I have ever had with a company   I was flying for work to a conference from Michigan to Pennsylvania. At my first flight of the day from Michigan to Chicago we were alerted that not all luggage was capable of fitting under the plane however the staff assured us that we would have our luggage at the end destination. After a 10 hour layover in Chicago I flew to Harrisburg Pennsylvania. My luggage containing all my work materials for the conference never showed up and was still in Michigan. The employee working baggage claim was indignant and overall rude. While working with me to get my information for me to file a missing bag report she stopped four times to start and finish other peoples’ requests after which she blamed me for not checking up on my luggage in Chicago as if I had any control over that. Following my dismissal from my conference for being unable to participate in my capacity the airline has still yet to send my luggage from Michigan. When I call to check on it I get the same indignant worker and there is no public ally available number to call in order to speak to someone about my issue. I would warn every customer who would check a bag with American against them. Their entire customer service is nonexistent and their employees are lackluster at best.   American Airlines had an almost 14 hour delay because of mechanical issues that they knew about the night before the flight. Despite this, after waiting 7 hours at the airport, I booked another flight as I had to be at my destination the same day. It cost almost double to fly on another airline. Instead of compensating me for the extra expense, American has offered only $25 in credit, less than $1 per hour of my delay. I have never experienced terrible customer service like this before. Be aware that if there are issues, American will leave you high and dry.   I’d like to start by saying how they have delays constantly that start out as a “40 minute delay” which then runs to 2 hours plus. Also I came from FL to take a 2+ hour flight completely out of the way to Chicago when my destination is New York? My normal arrival time was suppose to be 11:30 which now appears will be 1:30 if not later. We finally get on the flight and they tell us we cannot take off yet because the plane will not detach from the hallway. One inconvenience after the next. They don’t keep you updated, you only know your flight is even more delayed after you go up there and check it. I will always pay whatever the extra cost is to not take American Airlines - even Frontier might be better than them at this point. \\xa0 \\xa0I was on flight AA708 last night that was scheduled to depart at 9:15. Maintenance issues as we were sitting on the plane at the gate forever. Finally sent to another gate in the netherlands (Miami is a huge airport). We arrived in DCA after 3 am. This flight was made even more miserable because of the attitude of the flight attendants. In first class we were not even offered a cup of water or a biscotti though I asked for one. We hadn\\'t had anything since the last flight at 6. I did get to watch the flight attendants eat a bag of chips in their jump seats as they were right in front of me. Claimed it was too bumpy to serve. We were an arms length away from them. What has happened to service and a nice friendly demeanor?   Literally the worst airline ever! I missed my connecting flight to Marion due to delays by AA. The next flight was the next dat but they refused to put me in a hotel, said it was not their fault (air traffic). They also refused to give me a full refund. I don’t understand how they can treat customers like this, when they are clearly at fault.   Flew into Dallas with elderly parents yesterday. Took them to the airport today for another, short flight home. My father is disabled and requires a wheel chair, which was supposed to have been arranged before they ever left home 10 days ago. He is 84. My mother is 80. The desk agent requested a wheel chair, which was delivered. She said, \"here you go! \" No attendant, no help was provided as arranged prior. My mom had to push my dad to the gate herself. Masks are required in airports and on planes right now as everyone knows. Yesterday, while we were waiting for our flight to depart from North Carolina, quite a few passengers were not wearing masks in the waiting area. Same true on the plane. Not one AA employee asked these passengers to wear their masks. What\\'s the point of a mandate, if a major player like AA doesn\\'t enforce the rules? Lip service only? No one likes wearing a mask, but most of us do out of respect for fellow travelers. I think you may have forgotten that we are the customer. It\\'s about us not you!  Arrived at 4am to find out our pilot went AWOL and flight delayed 7 hours as they try to find a pilot to fly into Nashville to fly our plane. Customer service could care less - it is what it is attitude. I didn\\'t plan to spend my day in an overpriced uncomfortable airport with a mandated face mask on  American Airlines needs a new slogan \"fly with us we get you close to where you want to be\". I was flying with my husband and son out of Milwaukee to end up in Bangor Maine. I also arranged a flight for my cousin who is flying from Memphis to meet us in Bangor Maine. I ended up rerouted from Milwaukee to Charlotte North Carolina and back to Bangor Maine. My husband and son ended up in Philly with no possible flights for them to get to Bangor for a couple of days. They had to rent a car and drive 8 hours to get to Bangor. My cousin missed her connection in Washington due to a late flight and the delay of service agents that we\\'re helping her in her wheelchair. She was rerouted to Portland but the pilot couldn\\'t land so she ended up in Boston Massachusetts and had to take a bus alone to Portland at her own expense. I had to drive alone at night from Bangor to Portland to pick her up, 2 hours. American Airlines did nothing for us. And the associates working for American airlines were often quite rude. They have the attitude that we are lucky that they are showing up.   Scheduled to fly out from a relatively small-city airport. American Airlines abruptly cancelled the flight out (likely due to low flight volume or staffing/equipment issues as the weather was fine) with no warning and automatically booked me a new flight out 2 days later (my return date). No options to get me to my planned destination until well over 24 hours after I was initially supposed to arrive. On my first go-around with customer service, I waited on hold for 10 minutes to speak to a representative and after the call was connected they immediately hung up before I could speak a single word. On repeat (another 15 minutes at 4.45 am) I was able to speak to a representative who was able to confirm they had no capacity on any flights out until late the following day. Ended up needing to cancel my trip entirely. Unfortunately, this is not my first bad experience with American Airlines. Will be taking my business elsewhere in the future.   New York JFK to Indianapolis. Worse than a bus ride, but thankfully a relatively short regional flight. Usual American Airlines poor in flight standards, and unfriendly staff. One flies this airline only by necessity, not desire. The only redeeming quality of this particular flight was a charming reservations agent.   Firstly American flights are canceled and delayed and agents are not courteous and patient with customers. There are no explanations why flights canceled and the agents remarks they are tired and frustrated about it too. I begin my trip by arriving 3 hrs before my flight from ORD to ONT, to learnt at the checkin counter that my original flight is delayed and I will missed my connecting. At that time I had to beg the agent to look for another flight out from Chicago. However, after 40 mins or so, she got one through Phoenix. When I arrived Phoenix was further delay for 7 hrs before leaving at 11pm to ONT. My thoughts are the airline canceled flights then to combine passengers into one flight, but does not publish or shared with customers. They do not care how tired and harassed are the passengers that are going through this process. I had two important appointments that I missed during all this course of travel and none of the agents shows any concerns to the passengers that had to site for hours. The irony of all this, my checked bag was 50.05lbs and they asked me to open and remove something, so it get below 50lbs. Also, if you complained on an issue, they become very vindictive and further try to delay you from boarding American Airlines needs to improve on there schedule and retrain those agents that becomes complacent I am. Frequent traveler go AA and hope to continue, but they need to address and improve and stick to your reservation flights schedule.  Terrible, terrible, terrible. Nothing but terrible. Let’s just cancel somebody’s flight and not worry about how they\\'re going to get to their destination. Let’s say sorry we’ll put you on standby and that’ll be enough work. I will be telling everyone I know not to fly with this company. Nothing but terrible customer service.   Both my outgoing and return flights through DFW were delayed and connections missed. On the return flight the pilot just said DFW was backed up and kept giving a take off time and then extending it. Once we arrived at DFW the agent said the reason for delay was not given and he could not book a room. I was given a website with supposed discounts. The hotels did not specify if they had airport shuttles & when I asked another agent I was basically told I would have to figure it out. When the shuttle did pick us up, he immediately said .. let me guess, American Airlines, right? He proceeded to say American strands customers continually there. American customer service refused to reimburse for the hotel. They don’t seem to be concerned about losing customers either. I explained their continual delays causing missed connections takes away any benefit of a slightly lower price. In addition it takes the agent about 30 minutes per person to rebook the new flight so plan on being in line forever. If you choose to do business with American, I recommend looking for at least a 3 hour layover. I really can’t say anything good about this airline.  Everyone was standing and waiting to board plane when this American Airlines female Personnel started being rude to passengers by closing the lane right in front of their faces. I really don’t know if she was having a bad morning or what. Now, the second American Airlines Personnel singled me out from people that were boarding. I’ve seen people that boarded who\\'s carry-ons were much bigger and the Personnel only stopped me. She called a carry on weight check on me for no reason. AA can even check the cameras and you will see that. This rude Personnel got as rude as to say: “Thank you” twice for me to acknowledge her rude behavior. I did not even look at her. This lady only got mad because the passengers were talking about how the first AA Personnel closed the lane in their faces and was saying something under her breath while doing so. AA 2 thumbs down! Be nice to the passengers, it’s really because of the passengers that you all have a job‼️‼️   Absolutely the worst airline ever. Flight times are constantly changed. Booked flight with one hr layover. AA changed flight, creating 5 hr layover. When I called to change to another available flight with shorter layover, they tried to charge me more money! Flight was delayed twice, creating a 6 hr layover. Then, when boarding plane, agent pulled my family aside and forced us to check in our carry on luggage, while others were waived by with theirs (our bags were NOT over stuffed at all!). When we got to our seats, overhead bins were EMPTY and stayed that way until attendant closed for departure! So now, not only was our flight delayed, but we gave to wait for baggage claim to get our carry on bags. As long as government keeps bailing these guys out, nothing will change! Will never fly American again!   I am very frustrated with my flying experience. This airline did not impose any social distancing at all. People were crammed in this plane like sardines. There was a young woman directly behind us that refused to wear her mask. The flight attendants did not say anything to her. I told her to put her mask on and she told me that she had already had Coronavirus. I now have Covid 19 and so do 3 of my family members. I was negative before the trip and so were my family members. We tested because the state of Massachusetts required that we be tested before we entered the state. The flight I was on was #1843 from Charlotte, NC to Boston, MA on September 17, 2020. I just called the airline to report this incident to them, and they literally hung up on me after transferring me once.   Flight 703 CLT to BUF was diverted to PIT on Sunday, 25 June 2023, for valid reasons. Stuff happens. Vouchers were given for a hotel and for food. A voucher was promised for travel to hotels that did not have a shuttle service. The travel confirmation texted to my phone contained a link to american-airlines-passengers.tvlinc.com/. The page to which the link led provided a registration code for the hotel and a voucher for $12 for food. In the middle of the page, it said, \"No shuttle: Transport voucher will be available after hotel is booked.\" No vouchers were given at the gate in the airport. No voucher was given by the hotel. No voucher appeared in my American Airlines app. No voucher was offered today as I checked back in for the flight to BUF. We were told that all we had to do was to contact aa.com/refunds to file a claim for the travel to and from the hotel. 1. There is no option on aa.com/refunds to ask for transportation to and from the hotel. 2. A link in the support page asks whether the user would like to chat with support, but the page to which the link leads has no portal to a chat system. I do not think American Airlines is competent enough to be lying. They just do not know what they are doing. Stuff happens, but some stuff that happens is contemptible. I pass over the hour wait in PIT for a storage container to be delivered to the pantry. That is a whole other level of incompetence that just added ire to the fire.   Most disgusting. I am traumatised and having nightmares of how I have been treated flight after flight been cancelled. I was stuck at LA For three days. Never using it again and I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone else. Please do not use this airline.  Just got back from Brazil. We flew American Airlines both ways. We had a total of 18 flights there and back. Everything was good until we went to board in Miami. Before we even boarded the gate attendant was talking to a drunk guy saying “now we aren’t going to have anymore problems with you are we?” And the gate attendant held out his hand for the drunk guy to shake it and the drunk guy wouldn’t shake it. They still let the drunk guy board the plane. As we are in position to take off the flight attendant came over the PA telling him to sit down we are taking off. He did sit down but they still had several problems with him. So when we get 1 hour out from Miami they turn the plane around, without saying anything to us until we are just outside Miami. Than when we landed we landed to hard and broke the landing gear. We hit HARD. Security came and got the drunk guy off the plane and we are told that we just had to refuel than we would take off. After 1/2 hour they said that we had to take our stuff and get off the plane. We waiting in the airport for over 2 hrs and there where mothers with multiple babies and they would not get those women their strollers so they had to hold their babies the whole time and there was 1 lady with 4 babies under 6 months. Than after 3 hours they tell us they are rescheduling our flight for the next day and we couldn’t get our luggage. So hopefully you packed some clothes in your carry on, which we had. We finally got in our hotel room at 3am. We had not had anything to eat since our last flight at like 4pm. We where starving and nothing was open. The next day we did take off around 1pm but we ended up missing a whole day of our trip. It messed up our hotel, rental car. We did file a complaint with AA. They offered My husband $50 total for our inconvenience. My husband emailed them back and said he was insulted. So they ended up giving us $175 per person of AA credit. Who says we will ever fly with them again. They can shove that. We will never and I repeat NEVER fly with them again. Plus the food was horrible. We will pay extra to fly another airline. If your going to fly you might want to pay extra for a different airline, it will be worth it. They should have never let the drunk guy on the flight, they knew he was trouble. However AA doesn’t care. My husband was told well you got to your destination didn’t you. Yup we did the next day, we ended up in flight the whole day instead of being at the beach. Thanks for nothing AA!   Horrible, left 30 minutes late from Charlotte. No in-service beverages or food for a 4.5 hour trip to Phoenix. Had a medical emergency and had to stop in Amarillo. They did not have the ambulance ready for the passenger and apparently had to fill some oxygen tanks which took over 2 hours. We were on the plane for a total of 9 hours without any food or drinks for any passengers except first class. The seats on the A310 are very uncomfortable and there is no ability to charge your smart devices. Also, checking bags cost 30 dollars per bag. Would definitely not recommend.   I\\'ve flown with American Airlines numerous times over the years and have generally regarded them as a top-tier airline, offering excellent service and a comfortable flying experience. However, my recent encounter at the airport on March 1st has left a blemish on what I\\'ve always considered a reliable choice for air travel. American Airlines has seemingly adopted a new policy where their staff are directed not to assist customers directly unless through the use of the airline\\'s mobile app. This approach felt incredibly impersonal and contrary to the warm service I\\'ve come to expect. Observing staff members choosing to wear headphones and dismiss passenger inquiries directly contradicts the essence of customer service. This shift towards a more detached interaction is not only disappointing but signals a worrying trend in their service philosophy. Moreover, my dismay was further compounded when reviewing the safety brochures provided onboard. It appears American Airlines has taken to only labeling their aircraft as \"737,\" omitting any mention of it being a Boeing or the specific variant number. This choice strikes me as a deliberate attempt to obscure the exact model of the aircraft from passengers, perhaps out of embarrassment or a misguided attempt to sidestep potential scrutiny. This lack of transparency is not just a matter of corporate image; it directly impacts passenger safety by not fully informing them about the aircraft they are flying in. Despite these criticisms, it\\'s important to note that my experiences with American Airlines have overwhelmingly been positive, outside of these specific incidents. The quality of their flights, the professionalism of most of their staff, and the overall flying experience remain commendable. It\\'s disheartening to see such an esteemed airline let down by policies that seem to prioritize image over direct human interaction and safety transparency. It is my hope that American Airlines will reconsider these practices. There\\'s immense value in honest communication with passengers and in maintaining the high standard of service that has defined them for years. Addressing these issues would not only enhance their reputation but also reaffirm their commitment to passenger safety and satisfaction.  Miami to Las Vegas. I have flown American in the past. I recently booked a trip to Las Vegas and shortly after, the event in Vegas was cancelled due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. Spirit Airlines quickly refunded my money. Unfortunately, I was booked on American Airlines for the trip back from Vegas. American Airlines refused to refund my money. I wish I would have reviewed this airline first. I now know why they have such low ratings. Now I am stuck with a credit I will likely never be able to use before the year is up. Beware.   American Airlines is irresponsible loading us on a plane knowing there’s weather issues and that this older plane couldn’t have cold air.  No drinks offered. No plan for weather issues. I stopped flying with them years ago and today reminded me why. You can’t take people’s money and time, toss them on a plane when they easily could have been in the airport, eating, staying cool, etc. It’s ridiculous that they charge us for seats and luggage on top of the flight, only to screw with us.  Resentment and Apathy are the only emotions expressed by your team. I flew out to Seattle to mourn my father who died 4 days ago. I booked the shortest available return flight to get back to my 3 year old daughter. Your flight was delayed to the point that I missed my connector, lost 4 hours and my ride home. Your staff didn\\'t or couldn\\'t care or express even the slightest bit of empathy. The inhuman and callous disposition of these individuals stunned me and I can not in good conscience recommend this airline to anyone. I hope you never experience what I experienced today.   My bag did not make it from Miami airport to Atlanta airport like it was checked for. Instead my bag was sent to Houston, Texas. I made a baggage report immediately after getting off of my flight in Atlanta. The baggage office in Atlanta for #americanairlines was less than helpful. So I begrudgingly accepted their offer to have it transferred to Atlanta and delivered to my door. Well today in tracking my bag, it has now been to Houston, TX to Dallas, TX to  Denver, Colorado to  Atlanta, GA where for whatever reason it did not remain at said airport instead it was loaded onto a plane and sent to  Charlotte, NC now it is flying it’s happy self to Montgomery, AL. So here we are, my bag that was supposed to be on a straight flight from Miami, FL to  Atlanta, GA has now been to five *correction 6* different airports. Yet, no one. Not a soul has been able to tell me why it went to Houston to begin with or why after landing in Atlanta this afternoon it was sent to Charlotte, NC. I was assured that my bag is safe with the baggage claim people. But, can you really make that assurance when it cannot safely make it on a straight shot flight to the correct airport? Lesson learned. Check baggage claim statistics before checking a bag and never again with American Airlines. Disappointed, outraged and downright flustered is to say the least. Unfortunately I didn’t not pack my belongings with the assumptions my bag would be lost so when you see me sans makeup, and in a sports bra all week we can both silently cuss American Airlines together. Biggest waste of money checking the bag, should’ve just left everything I packed in Miami to begin with and purchased all new stuff. It might’ve been less frustrating to do that in the first place, but here we are. Needless to say proceed with caution. During my own experience I have seen numerous other HORROR stories of dealing with this airline and their inability to actually care for their passengers and belongings. There is no in flight entertainment they do expect you to use your personal device.   The flight was delayed, overcrowded and overpriced ($700 for a domestic flight with one connection, booked several months in advance of the trip). My checked bag was broken when I retrieved it from the baggage carousel at O\\'Hare, One wheel was snapped off and the hard shell was broken so that the foam underneath shows through and it\\'s unusable. The baggage helpdesk filed a report and gave me a receipt and told me to wait for the claim to be processed. I waited and then tried to follow up with a claim submission online but the American Airlines site isn\\'t working. When I tried to fill in a claim amount, the form is stuck on \\'0.00\\'. American Airlines also expects a receipt for the purchase of my suitcase (who keeps those)? The claim should be for replacement not for original purchase. Then I tried calling customer service and never got through. I finally talked to customer service in January \\'23 was told that the 30 day limit for claims has expired. I did as advised and think that American Airlines make the claims process so impossible that they are not accountable for any damage. Avoid this airline if you can.   Dirty Check in area. Uninterested staff. Boarding a fiasco and onboard poor service and constant loud announcements. This is my 3rd flight with AA in 4 days. Very poor airline. Will avoid when I can. Should not be in the OneWorld. Not up to the desired level.  Flying used to be my favorite method of travel, but the airlines have been terrible as of late and American Airlines has been the worst. I have had to fly using American several times this year and not a single time has a flight not been cancelled or delayed. This most recent trip has been the worst experience yet as they cancelled my connecting flight during mid-flight, rebooked me for a flight that boarded in 15 minutes after landing that was also on the opposite side of the airport, and then promptly delayed the flight, and they also added a stop to my travel that had a layover of 6 hours. I am fine using American Airlines and will be driving for my travels as much as possible as the airlines can\\'t be trusted to be reliable.   Flying American\\'s Flagship First is the best end-to-end experience on offer by any US airline. They are the only US-based carrier flying 3 and 4 cabin aircraft with a true first class, and the only one offering a premium ground experience and first class lounge. The experience can vary widely from one crew to another, but I\\'m generally pleased more often than not. For this flight, I was staying at the TWA Hotel at JFK\\'s Terminal 5, just a short walk and ride on the AirTrain from American\\'s location in Terminal 8. I headed to the terminal about 2.5 hours before boarding to enjoy the lounges and get a bite to eat. I skipped the dedicated First Class check-in counter at Terminal 8 since I already held my boarding pass and was not checking bags. There was no line for PreCheck, and within 5 minutes of arriving at the terminal, I was airside and in the elevator to the Admirals Club in Concourse B, which is home to the Flagship Lounge and Flagship First Dining facilities. I was greeted by the lounge attendant and immediately invited to follow her to the Flagship First dining room, which is within the Flagship Lounge, within the Admirals Club. A lounge, within a lounge, within a lounge - a third-level of exclusivity, which is pretty cool and unique among US-based airlines. I was seated and handed an a la carte food menu and wine list, both of which were quite impressive. The food was outstanding, as was the wine selection on offer, including Laurent-Perrier Grans Siecle Champagne (retails at $160/bottle). Approximately 10 minutes before boarding, I headed to the C Concourse and arrived at the gate about 5 minutes after boarding started to find that they had most of the passengers already onboard this half-empty flight. I arrived at my seat, 2F, finding two pillows, a duvet, and blanket, along with a bottle of water and a basic Shinola branded amenity kit. Immediately upon settling in, a very kind flight attendant handed me a pair of Bang and Olufsen noise canceling headphones and took my order for a pre-departure drink (yes, this is still on offer in F cabin, even during service reductions for COVID) - I naturally chose the Champagne, which was not on par with that served in the Flagship First dining room, but still very good. The first class seat itself on the A321T is one of the best seats on any American aircraft, and is a modification of the seat in the business cabin on their 777-300ER fleet. It is a reverse-herringbone 1-1 layout across five rows for a total of ten seats in the cabin. The opportunity to fly in a reverse-herringbone seat on a narrowbody aircraft is such a great experience, and the most exclusive-feeling cabin you can find. The fact that this route serves a lot of NBC Universal traffic only adds to that experience, as many passengers in F cabin are A list celebrities. The flight attendant working F on this flight was very friendly and attentive, keeping glasses full and passengers feeling like they are truly traveling in a premium cabin. The food was again restaurant-quality, with first courses being served separately from the main course. As an aside, AA was supposed to be implementing \"reduced\" service in all cabins due to the Omicron surge, however, that was definitively not the experience on this flight. Bravo to American Airlines for keeping the product and level of service outstanding, and a truly first class experience.   So first the flight gets changed from a 2:30pm arrival to now 10:45 pm if lucky. Now pushing a 3 hr layover in DFW instead of 1 hr. The plane was at the gate and not boarding because get this \"They can\\'t find the mechanic that boarded the plane\". Awesome customer service BTW. If you love being treated with the \"we don\\'t care attitude\", then by all means buy an overpriced ticket from these chumps and enjoy your dreaded trip.    Would give zero if I could. By far the worst baggage experience of my life. They took 15 minutes to get a manager out and my toddler got impatient, started messing around and fell hard. Traveling as a military family is always stressful, but on our way out on American Airlines, the baggage attendant did not make a big deal, just checked all our bags, even the overweight ones and sent us on our way in 5 minutes. The baggage personnel have in DC kept us waiting and then charged us $200 anyway. Managers can waive fees. The choice was help us out or screw us over and they chose the latter. I have never had worse service from airline personnel and will never fly American Airlines again.   Flight itself was ok. Plane was delayed 3.5 hours due to weather (not their fault). However when we finally got off the plane around 10pm after sitting on the tarmac for another hour due to same weather, we could not get our luggage. It had somehow beat us there and they had locked it in a office with a glass front. No one was there to open it and we and a lot of other people had to wait over an hour for someone to come. I said we have been waiting over an hour to which the airline employee said I\\'ve been here since 10am. He never apologized and said ok when I said we would probably never use them again. Not good customer service at all and not as friendly as Southwest is.   The desk attendants were not communicative as we attempted to board the first time. Mind you we paid for an upgraded seat since my fiancé is a giant. So as we got on the plane (after a 30 min delay) we were told to get off the plane due to maintenance issues. The plane was in lobby for over 2 hours after it’s last trip. Then they delayed us for an additional hour. Just for us to go back to the terminal and to find out that they are reboarding the plane without announcing anything. Original time of departure was 5:15 Then 5:45, then 7:40 then 7pm.  I rebooked my flight on the phone for the same flight but different day at 6:15 am. And then it turned out that he booked 6 am flight. When I got to the airport only 1 person was at the ticket area and it took forever to get to her and then she told me that I should run and that I might not make it to the flight. I got to the gate and I wasn’t let into the aircraft cuz it was closed then I asked to put me on the flight that was leaving in 15 minutes so I could find different way. The agent made me stand there for 20 minutes. I told her that if she won’t help me then the next flight will be closed too. Of course few more minutes passed and then she started helping me and then said the other flight is closed now too. When initially I asked her for help people were still boarding. Then I got rebooked for 6 hours later flight. That was delayed twice. I saw that there is another flight leaving via different city so I asked for help. The lady didn’t want to help me. I said later this flight will close so I get stuck. Of course 10 minutes later different person is helping me and the first woman says I am closing this flight now. I told her but I asked you to help me and she said that she is closing it. Total nightmare and short staffing and incompetent people. Never again!  Harrisburg to San Diego. Changed my flight times without warning. Didn’t give me an option to rebook at no charge, so I called. Wait time of 4-hours. So I go on the app and get new flights. Charges me the difference, but surely that will get refunded? Get a call more than six hours later only to be told that it’s my mistake for not speaking to an agent, no refunds or credits. Speak to the manager, he tells me he would never have given his credit card number and you know what happens when you assume. He then switches gears and tells me he’ll me a favor or a partial credit. Has kept me on hold for more than twenty minutes just for that. I couldn’t even cancel the whole thing because it no longer qualifies. I am just so, so done.   I had 3 flight credits for myself and my kids due to my flight being cancelled and originally had main cabin tickets. When re-booking I was told I could not use the credits to book a basic economy flights, however they could not direct me to the terms and conditions were it stated that information. I tried getting assistance from their online customer service and I was told to call Customer Service. After speaking with 3 reps and 1 supervisor (all very rude and not willing to help), I was stuck having to pay another $400 more so that these credits did not cancel. The supervisor I spoke to from Dallas was extremely defensive, would not let me finish and when I got transferred again to online web support she refused to give me her name and disconnected the call.   Absolutely terrible. If you want to be threatened, have your flight cancelled, delayed, rescheduled multiple times then choose American Airlines. If you want to be removed from your flight when it\\'s boarding, then choose American airline. They have the rudest customer service I\\'ve ever witnessed. They\\'ll hang up on you as you\\'re asking a question or call you a liar if you\\'re at the desk. Had the manager tell me I couldn\\'t get a transportation voucher a week ahead of time and to call a 1-800 number to then call the 1-800 number and be told it\\'s not possible to call and get a voucher. Missed 2 days worth of business meetings, had 3 flight delays, got removed from my flight, got threatened against trying to get my bag.  The only way to get any kind of compensation is to fill out a form on their website where they don\\'t even reply! It\\'s been almost 2 weeks and haven\\'t heard anything back from them. I booked with a different airline for my return flight and didn\\'t even take my trip back with them.   The airline was notifying customers about changes through text but we would have the captain come over and give us a completely different information. The airline staff was rude to customers about updates. They took our bags off of our flight because they thought we were an inbound flight. They handled the adversity of weather terribly.   First flight delayed, changed my booking offering me a night on the airport floor in London, because they \\'could not book a hotel there\\'. An hour of explaining I cannot sleep on the floor, because I\\'m pregnant, changed flight for next day (booked me a hotel that blocked money on my credit card as a \\'deposit\\' (still did not get it back). In total 2 flights delayed (out of 3), 3-days journey to Europe (instead of 20 hours), a $12 voucher that doesn\\'t work, extremely rude and unhelpful customer service (when mentioned I was unable to put a suitcase on a scale due to pregnancy I heard that \\'I should have thought more carefully while packing\\'. Ended up with pain and bleeding due to stress and bad treatment, endangered pregnancy.  This is not the first time we have had problems with American Airlines. We flew from Indianapolis Indiana and had a connecting flight in Charlotte which turned out to be a disaster. While waiting in line to board the plane a confrontation broke out and they took everyone back off the plane. We sat for four hours before they decided to cancel the flight without any information as to why. They went from saying the plane needed maintenance to saying there was a confrontation. We had our six children along with us with two being infants. We had to stay overnight in Charlotte which caused us to begin our vacation late which also ruined our car rental arrangement and caused us to have to get a smaller vehicle at a much higher rate than our original and scheduled plan. The vehicle did not work for my size family which cause us to not be able to do what we planned with our children which ruined our family vacation because the agreement was non refundable. And to make matters worse the plane from Orlando to another connecting flight in Charlotte had a delay which caused us to almost miss our connecting flight home. The latest flights with American Airlines have just been horrible.   \\r\\nWe were supposed to have a flight from Indianapolis to Miami and from Miami to Punta Cana on 10/01. Our flight in Indianapolis was supposed to board at 5:38AM, so we woke up at 2:45 in the morning to get to the airport by 4:00AM. Around 4:30 our flight got delayed to 10:00AM, causing us to miss our connecting flight to Punta Cana. Originally we didn’t think this would be a big deal, we figured American Airlines would just change our connecting flight to a later one. Well, we were wrong. The soonest they claimed they could get us to Punta Cana was 6:00PM the NEXT day. For no particular reason other than there was no room in other connecting flights for the rest of the day. This was incredibly frustrating for several reasons. First of all, we woke up at 2:45 in the morning to get to the airport and they didn’t let us know our flight was delayed until last minute. After looking at the previous flights, they knew it was going to be delayed for a while and failed to tell anyone. The second reason being that they made no accommodations whatsoever to get us to our destination in a reasonable amount of time. The third reason being that we have had this trip planned for over a year, it is our honeymoon, and now we are losing 40 hours out of our only 4 day vacation. This is the first time either of us have flown with American Airlines and it will be our last. They 100% ruined our honeymoon and made it the most stressful trip we’ve ever been on, when it was supposed to be the most relaxing. They offered for us to stay in a hotel in Miami, which we accepted. However, the hotel is less than desirable and quite frankly looks embarrassing and gross. They didn’t offer any other accommodations such as food, quicker flights, or some sort of refund. We will be losing money on our all inclusive resort that we paid for. We tried to change the day we leave our honeymoon after we found out about this delay to have more time on vacation, but there were limited options available through American Airlines and now there’s the concern that our flight home will get delayed as well. Normally I’m an easygoing person but this has been an absolutely horrible experience, a ruined honeymoon, and money lost. We worked so hard to be able to afford this vacation, to have the time off for work, and we haven’t been on a vacation together before. We wanted this honeymoon to he special at an all inclusive resort where we can enjoy each other and our experience. We won’t be able to go on another vacation like this for a very long time. We needed this time off for ourselves but this was not a vacation at all. It was just stressful. After reading other reviews I see how awful American Airlines has been to other customers as well. We will never use them again. \\xa0\\xa0Worst customer service! Flight delayed due to weather. Next flight out was 20 hours. Would not reimburse hotel or food “since it was an air traffic control, not mechanical”. Went to ask about my stand by at gate agent. “That’s not my flight so I can’t help you”. Will tell and share with EVERYONE not to fly American.   Spirit Airlines canceled our flight without notice, we\\'re stuck in Philadelphia Airport, American Airlines had two seats left on a flight leaving in 45 minutes. The girl at the desk was patient and polite and hooked us up, the plane actually waited for us to aboard. I can\\'t thank American Airlines enough for coming through.  This is the second time in two months they have canceled my flight on the day of departure. Spirit is even better than this. I will never use this airline again.   I am not one to complain or even take the time to write reviews but I am so upset and this is all I can do! The aircraft was terrible old quality. It didn’t feel safe or comfortable. Crammed space and no leg room at all. Tiny windows that you can’t see out of unless you’re in the window seat. I am supposed to arrive back home tonight at 10pm. I have to work tomorrow morning. I can not miss work. They let me know that my flight was delayed (causing me to miss my connecting flight. I’d either have to pay for an entire new flight or pay for a hotel in the connecting city because I won’t get home in time). They are allowing me to change flights at no charge of course, but this doesn’t help me since the next available isn’t for 24 hours. Meaning I won’t just be late for work but I will miss the day entire day of appointments. When I called customer service they said there’s nothing they can do for me, and hung up on me!  American Airlines has ignorant, zero empathy gate agents. I have anxiety on losing luggage because I had lost my luggage twice prior. At boarding gate I tried to explain that to the two gate agents and wait to board last. When being asked if no over head bin space left would I agree to check bag. I did agree. When walking to my seat I found space left in the over head bin. I asked to have my carry on stored there but was refused. The senior Gate agent went up to the plane with a completely stone face and say no because you want to store your bag that means we have to keep your bag there with absolutely no empathy for my anxiety. She seemed to enjoy watching my anxiety kicks.   The worst people to fly with, never be there in time, that’s if your lucky and didn’t miss your connection. Always they have something to delay and they deal with you like they do a favor for you?  If you have a choice please don’t fly American Airlines. I have flown over 100 plus flights and American Airlines is with out a doubt the worst! Latest flight was from Fresno to Pittsburgh. Was told the plane didn’t have enough fuel to make it to Dallas, where my connection was. We had to fly to San Jose for fuel! I have never heard of this. Because of this I missed my connection. When I arrived in Dallas, I was told there was no more flights to Pittsburgh. Was rebooked the following day. I had to fly to Chicago which was also not part of my original flight with a over 2 plus hour layover and then to Pittsburgh around 5 that evening. 5 airports and 27 hours later I arrived at my destination, which was originally a 7 hour flight. Most of the American Airlines workers offer little help and are rude. Please if you have the option choose a different airline.   I paid over $200 for Main cabin plus because I am 6 months pregnant & incredibly uncomfortable. For all four of my flights to and from Boston, I was told they gave my reserved seats away & that I would be reimbursed. After weeks of emails (they have nobody to contact by phone), they told me sorry but seats aren’t guaranteed. The upgrade to Main cabin plus was a complete scam. I was crammed in a middle seat in the back of the plane, while having to get up and bother my neighbors for frequent bathrooms breaks & leg movement. On our flights from Boston to Maui there was no food given or available for purchase (both over 6 hour flights). NO free entertainment or option to purchase wifi. Total Scam.  I booked business class round trip for my elderly parents to fly to Lebanon. I was told American Airlines has the best service and I went with them. They arrived all fine however the trip back started with one disaster after the other. Their connecting flight from Dallas to Tampa was full and they were bumped from Business to economy. With no word of difference in payment or anything now mind you their trip was $8400! I thought a reputable (little did I know) company would reimburse the change. My parents arrived to Dallas after a 10 hour flight, they were waiting at the gate ready to board. All of a sudden flights got canceled. All American Airlines from Dallas were canceled. Again things happen. However what doesn’t happen is the rude unprofessional customer service I received from their employees! The lady at the counter in Dallas should be trained on how to talk to people. I was more than polite and I told her I understand she is raising her voice because of frustration all I want to know is where my parents luggage was at the moment so I can plan on booking another trip for them. She was belligerent, insensitive, and rude. I was not getting an answer so I called customer service. I was on hold for 4 hours. No one knew where their luggage was! Transferred from one department to the other. Now mind you I am telling them my dad is an 86 year old diabetic and he has enough meds to for the flight the rest in the luggage. After hours on the phone and my parents being in a hotel. The airline tells me I have to call again in the afternoon which I was on the phone already waiting for 5 hours the afternoon was 30 min to book another night and they might not get the same hotel! I begged the lady not to do that because the wait is ridiculous long and it’s only 30 min away for the afternoon. Of course I got the I am sorry I can’t do anything. Hung up I called right after and waited for another 4 hours until I reached a human to talk to. They gave me list of hotels far from where my parents are staying and I have to pay for an Uber to move them. I tried to tell the lady on the phone that they are old and need help they can’t do all of that on their own, all I got was right, yes. Sorry, they have to move! So we had to pay for the night at the hotel. And good to eat and drink. Which really was not in the plan at all! After two days in Dallas they finally arrive to Tampa of course with a delay! When we got there and asked for luggage I was told the luggage arrived the day before! And no one from the people on the phone was able to tell me that! I could have booked a flight on other airlines. If I could rate American Airlines a below zero I would. After paying a business class ticket and being treated like that with American Airlines I would never fly with them again   I had booked my wife’s and my vacation to Jamaica. Our return flight was MBJ to MIA to DCA. Considering this was an international flight, I accounted for the TSA check and all required procedures and as such had a 4 hr layover at MIA. Our flight from MBJ was delayed close to 3 hrs. As a result, we arrived at MIA barely in time with 45 minutes to go. We had to go collect our baggage, and the misery continued. Unfortunately we missed our connection. Tried rebooking and as if we haven’t had enough screw ups, my wife was placed 5 spots down on the standby list from me. How this level of stupidity could happen I don’t know. As spots became open they agents could not put my wife and I on the flight. All this to say, at 8pm We were still at MIA. With no care or sympathy from this airline. For what should’ve been a postponed honeymoon, this was the worst nightmare for me and my wife.   Worst airline I have ever flown on. We were to fly out Saturday. Flight cancelled but not rebooked until Monday. On Monday flight cancelled after we got to the airport with no warning. Rebooked for Tuesday night 8:30 pm. Tuesday 11pm they canceled the flight until 7:00 am Wednesday. Maintenance problem on plane that they fixed then the flight crew left (watched them walk past all the waiting passengers). American Airlines doesn’t care a bit.   Our flight attendants were the best ever. We were traveling with two kids and they were so so helpful. One of them a name was Gabrielle and she came and offered to hold my baby and then wrote my three year old a note and gave her chocolate. I will fly again with American just because their staff is so nice   I had to fly to Warsaw Poland to attend funeral of my father. I bought ticket with layover in London, England. When I arrived to the airport, an extremely rude AA attendant told me that I need a locator form for covid. She would not tell me what and how. She only said that it needed to be done. When I asked her a question she said she doesn’t know anything about it only that it needs to be done. By the time I filled 3 pages on slow internet cell phone, my flight boarding was closed. They told me they can rebook me for the next day. The next day I arrived to the airport with the locator form and the same AA woman stopped me. When I showed her my locator form she told me that I need to re do it all because I put British Airways flight number and it needs to be AA number because the AA is the operating airlines. I re did the form but the line to ticketing was so long that by the time I got to the counter my flight finished boarding. I begged them to process me because this is the second day I’m trying to fly. They didn’t want to talk to me. They told me I need to stand in line. Just awful, cold , unhelpful.  Because of their red tape nonsense they would not let me fly. I will never fly American Airlines for the rest of my life.  Four of us were traveling under my husband\\'s AA status due to his status. We had 6 bags with us traveling back from SEA-TAC to CLT from a cruise. One bag was left in SEA-TAC and we don\\'t have any idea why. When notifying AA baggage office in CLT, we are told to fill out this LOST baggage claim online. A link was provided. No where in the required information are you given an option of picking it up at the airport or having it delivered. At submission of the information, it just states \"the bag will be delivered\". You are provided a file # to reference and it has this picture of status bar of where your luggage is once it has been found. I got one confirmation email of the submission but nothing else. My husband is notified this morning that the bag is at CLT. I didn\\'t get a single update. No \"we found your bag\", \"bag is enroute\", \"bag has landed\", \"bag is out for delivery\"... NOTHING. When I go to my initial email with the link to check status, it immediately goes to a webpage where it says my claim has been closed. I don\\'t have my luggage, so how can the claim be closed. My husband is flying the next morning so we go to baggage claim to get my luggage. They tell him it has to be delivered because that is what we asked for. No we didn\\'t. There was no option for delivery or pick up. So now AA is going to give it to a 3rd party company to deliver my bag and possibly run into another theft situation from CLT. This is the most unprofessional and a level of incompetence I have not run into in a long time. To boot, I can\\'t even get anyone on the phone to voice my issues. I have to rely on chat and email complaints. This is a failure to simply do your job. They can\\'t even get a claim submission completed properly and keep someone informed. How hard is it???  American Airlines repeatedly delayed our flight for five hours, but didn’t send any text notifications until very late at night. If they had notified us, I would have waited at home. When I asked the attendant if it was just going to be canceled they said “probably but you will need to wait here and see”. Finally they notified that the flight was canceled. The customer line was hours long and it was already past midnight so I couldn’t wait the whole time. I tried to rebook a flight in the app but it said there were no flights for several days even though I could see online that there was a flight available the next morning! In the process of investigating a flight cancelation for a refund it canceled my flight entirely without asking for my confirmation or giving any information about the refund process. Then they confirmed that they will not give me any refund even though they ruined my holiday and I am missing my friends wedding. I have now been sitting on hold with the airline for 2 hours and 27 minutes and they have zero information about how long they will keep me on hold. Photo attached of hold time with the AA customer service line. This is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline and I will never be flying with them again. If they treat customers worse than Spirit or Frontier, then they deserve to be treated like the garbage airline they are.   Although I could see some temporary justification for stopping all alcohol sales I don’t think it should continue. If you have issues with rowdy passengers just ban it on the routes that had problems. Whatever you do, train your flight crews to know that the ban was not COVID related. If COVID was your justification I would not still be able to purchase alcohol on international flights or in first class. A drink is a drink in terms of lowering masks to consume. American has always been my preferred airline but continued out of touch policies like this are why I am in the significant majority that still tries to think you are a good airline.  Had too many arrangements that were cancelled because of their delay. I tried to talk to them to get voucher and they don’t give vouchers except for connected flights. Why do I have to cover their mistakes? It is annoying when a company does a mistake and you have to fix their issue, while it is their problem.   So happy with our experience. Everyone was so sweet and accommodating. I asked the team to ask the pilot to congratulate my boyfriend for receiving his masters because our family couldn’t make it and they did! It was really the cherry on top of our trip back home.  Is it typical practice to notify of delays via text/email, but not gate changes or early arrivals of planes via text or email? Husband is stuck in a DC airport after a full day of weather delays today with American. Oddly, my MIL and niece flew from SLC with no delays. Clear weather radars.  This airline blows. Delay after delay after delay. All over a stewardess. Get me on a plane. I will never fly this thing again. Know so many people that work here but we’ve got delayed on all 4 of the flights and they lost our baggage going into Mexico. Absolute shame of a business for one of “the biggest and best”.   My wife and I purchased a flight in April of \\'21 for an upcoming return trip from Panama in January of \\'22. We had to cancel it because it turns out I am going to be undergoing chemotherapy during that time. According to AA\\'s rules we could get a voucher good for travel up to 1 year from the original booking date, meaning we had to use it by April of \\'22. The problem is that I would still be immune-compromised in April and travel would be very risky. So I contacted AA\\'s customer service and asked that they extend the voucher for even just a couple of months until it was safe for me to fly. Chad and his team went beyond what I asked and gave us until the end of 2022 to fly. The airlines get a ton of bad press these days, but in this case American Airlines showed that they had my best interest in mind. Thank you, AA!   Philadelphia to Orlando. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I was scheduled to fly to Orlando on 2/6 to attend the UCA High School Cheer Nationals and see my daughter (who is a Senior) compete for the final time. My flight was cancelled because the originally scheduled flight crew did not have enough flight hours left. Because American does not have a business continuity plan in place with stand-by flight crews, they had to cancel the flight. They had no other flights available forcing me to book a much more expensive flight with another airline. In turn, I missed my daughter\\'s competition. American refused to compensate me for the added expense I had to incur because of their failure. They refused to offer me anything more than $100 voucher or 5000 points for the fact I missed my daughter\\'s competition - they even made it sound like they were doing me a favor. What am I supposed to do with that?! That gets me nothing. They also refused to compensate me for the hotel cost for the night I lost in Orlando. I am completely unsatisfied with their handling of this situation and told them so. They just don\\'t care. I even asked the person I spoke with if this would satisfy her and she said it would not. I do acknowledge it was a rainy day and weather delays are out of their control but we could have flown if a flight crew was available. We even boarded the plane before they cancelled the flight. My daughter was devastated that I missed her performance. This is what makes me most angry. We can never get that experience back.   Pros: All flights departed on time, all seat selections honored including extra leg room, ground crew and cabin crew pleasant, meals and beverages were fine, all luggage made it to the final destination and all flights smooth. Cons: Check-in at EZE was chaotic. AA has multiple evening flights departing and check-in opens for all flights at the same time so 100\\'s of people swarming around trying to figure out where to be. No signage or direction as to what line to get in to. My partner and I were split up into different lines even though we were together and on the same ticket (strange, but it all worked out). Passport and security checks were very crowded and took way too long. Finally made it to the gate where there was room to relax, sit and get some air before the flight home. My issues were more with EZE airport and not AA. I see so many negative comments about AA but I am happy to say that my luck with the airline has always been a good one. A side note about SFO airport. They have done away with all foreign currency exchange stations at the airport and that includes the international terminal. You will have to find other alternatives outside the airport to exchange foreign currency.   I don’t like to leave reviews, but after the constant let down by American Airlines has been giving us, a review has to be made. We booked back in October 2022 for my husbands and I honeymoon with reserved seats. After checking in the boarding ticket completely switched our seats and the customer service response was that the system changed it and they have no guarantee that we’d get the seats. Last time I checked I didn’t book with Southwest Airlines. I had hoped our honeymoon would pan out to be different, but obviously the phrase “fool me once-shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me” is so true when booking with this airline.   Absolutely rubbish customer service. From beginning to end flight attendants were disinterested, rushed, unorganised and totally focused on doing as little as possible. Food was borderline inedible and unacceptable for a route of that length. Seat is uncomfortable and cramped. This airline should not be able to codeshare with other oneworld partners as they don’t even come close to their levels of service. I would never use them again.   American Airline does not take accountability for the flight delays, rebooking and cancellations. I was rebooked for the next day due to a problem with the airline. No weather issues. I went to the rebooking center to find out what happened, and they stated their system automatically detects when they don\\'t think you will make the connecting flight and rebook you. I advised the agent that I will need to make it home today. She stated if I booked with another airline, American should refund me for the return flight because it was not due to weather and due to American Airlines issue. When contacting American airline they are trying everything in their power to not give me my refund because they say I didn\\'t call them the same day. I contacted them and I was advised to contact my booking agency (booking.com). So, I contacted my booking agency on 12/21/22 (the same day) advising them that I was being rebooked and needed to receive a refund. I reached back out to booking.com today 12/27/22 because I hadn\\'t heard anything. Booking.com advised that I should call American and ask them to give booking.com the control of the ticket in order to refund me. When I called American Airlines, the agent basically told me to send an email to AA.com because it was nothing she could do. I can\\'t believe they are taking no accountability for their wrongdoing. To make matters worse I have another booking with them for Jan 13th & 15th. After that, I will never fly American again. They are worse than Southwest. It\\'s worth paying the extra to fly Delta Airline.  Delayed my connecting flight and then filled my seat even though I had a seat purchased and arrived before departure. These thieves overbook then pass the problems to customers.   First they forgot to load our bags on our connecting flight from Miami to PR, then when we were returning back to Pittsburgh they sold my seat and we had to pay $180 to get home. Horrible 1800 customer service. I want a call back and a refund for your mess up!   Omaha to Key West via Chicago . They delayed our flight into Chicago for weather which is understandable but they told us they would hold our connecting flight to Key West from Chicago. We got to the gate and they were just closing the gate to the flight and wouldn’t let us on. It took customer service 2 hours to get us on a different flight to Fort Myers. We ended up waiting in Chicago for 6 hours for the flight. We finally get to fort Myers and they sent our luggage to key west. We call to key west and they won’t even deliver our luggage to the hotel or anything. No refund of any kind. We spent about an extra $1200 to cover the mess up. Not happy at all and will never fly with them again.   Absolutely terrible. First they delay the flight for multiple hours, then they change the gate without notifying my wife or I, then they try to claim that they called our names over the loud-speaker which they absolutely did not. We barely made the flight. Never flying with them again and I suggest you do the same.   Worst airline ever. Would rather take a bus across the ocean than fly American again. Only fly when I have to and am literally NEVER on time. Dog sled through the desert would get you somewhere faster.   I checked in at Sacramento and it printed out both boarding passes for me and my fiancé for this flight and my San Diego to Charlotte. Sacramento to Charlotte was fine through Alaska airlines. They said I would be fine with the seats I picked from San Diego to Charlotte which was American Airlines. When we get there they said I never checked in and gave my seats away. I was not able to sit next to my fiancé who had medical conditions that needed my assistance. That was poor customer service   American Airlines has the absolute worst customer service that I have ever experienced. We had an international trip that we weren\\'t able to take due to Covid restrictions in the country. AA refused to give us our money back and instead gave us credits (which otherwise we would have never used by flying their airline). We went ahead and booked a trip in the US and followed all of their policies for the booking with credits a non-stop flight. Now they have changed the flight schedule and the flight option significantly interferes with our plans or requires us to fly in the middle of the night with a child or choose an option with at least 1 stop. Again, absolutely no consideration for this inconvenience to our trip despite contacting their customer relations department 4 times. I have never been treated with such a lack of customer care ever. I will never fly American Airlines again nor will I recommend them. Buyer beware, they create policies and take your money and hold you hostage to it.   I have been a customer since 2004 - tell me why when I have been so loyal and a repeat customer to AA are you so unwilling to treat your customers with respect and courtesy? I tried to book a award travel flight online and also purchase a flight for my brother - on the same reservation. I was told by a few agents that I needed to call in to book both together and now they are saying that I cannot book both together. What is the purpose of paying an annual fee to my credit card each year if I cannot enjoy the benefit of allowing myself and my guest to travel with me and have the baggage fee waived? It seems like your company just cares about nothing but the $$$ and not your customers. You should make it possible that my companion - regardless of them being booked on my reservation or separately, get their bag waived if I am present - which I would be. I am so turned off by your company. You end up leaving me no choice but to go fly with United and bid farewell to American. It is truly disappointed!   American Airlines made us wait three days in Mexico due to a blizzard. Completely understand, but the connection flight from Cancun through Miami was impossible to connect if you were sat on the second half of the airplane. My family ran since we got of the airplane and we were 8 minutes before flight departure to the gate and they would not let us in, the gate closed 10 minutes before departure. We were 2 minutes late to gate closure. They were late on departing to Miami and they could not even wait a few minutes to close the connecting gate to San Francisco Horrible!, not traveling with them again.   I have never had such a terrible experience with an airline. The morning we were to leave (4 hours before takeoff to be exact) AA rescheduled our flights for the following morning which would completely mess up our travel plans. After nearly 3 hours of waiting on hold with CS, we were adamant on getting put on to another airliner and they finally did so after insisting that we drive to another airport 2 hours away to try to get to our destination on that day. Coming home was just as bad. Not only was the check in process complete chaos, but they were asking people to volunteer to change flights due to overbooking (as a means to make more $ off of people who don’t show up). We then had a 3 hour layover which then turned into 4 hours due to their delays. After 12 hours of traveling we finally get home to realize AA never put our luggage on the plane- we were there for FOUR hours. There’s no reason any luggage should get left behind after such a long layover. The worst part is that the airline really doesn’t seem to care about customer service/experience. They’re just trying to make up for lost time and only care about your money. Please, take your hard earned money elsewhere and do not fly with American. They will make your travel plans miserable and show a single ounce of sympathy for it.   American Airlines is the worst trash company that exists. Cancelled our flight hours before takeoff, managed to find a new flight tomorrow with a massive layover. Their only customer service is through their website, supposed to get a response within 7-10 business days.   This was the most horrible flight ever. Literally flights getting delayed and them not doing absolutely anything about it, saying it is not there fault or issue. They were rude, over the phone they tried to help, but everyone else in person was just disrespectful and rude. They have horrible communication - one person would tell us one thing, and another person would tell us completely different. Absolutely ridiculous, figure out the system American, you guys were horrible, never flying again   A week before leaving for Hawaii on Delta, I checked the American Airlines APP as well to set up the return flights on American, and then saw instead of us flying into Buffalo, we were being flown into Toronto, Canada. If I had not checked before we left for Hawaii, we wouldn\\'t even have had passports! We could not fly into Toronto anyway, and I thought we were out of luck even going on the trip because of Easter break and a lack of availability at such a late date for changes. I live chatted with 2 AA reps, and the 2nd was fantastic. She arranged the 3 flights home starting in the evening from Honolulu on 4/17/2022. When I asked why Priceline or AA hadn\\'t notified me of the change to Toronto, an explanation wasn\\'t provided by either AA or Priceline. I have read, and have heard from travelers, about issues with American Airlines. However, our 3 flights home went so smoothly that it was impressive. I just assumed we\\'d get delayed or have aircraft issues. But, we didn\\'t, and not only that, the crew on each flight was also fantastic. I would fly American Airlines again. Unfortunately, these are trying times in general. Thank you!  I have never in my life been spoken to on any airline ever the way an attendant spoke to me. It was so embarrasing to me to have her blurt out what the problem was. Yes I did have a pet carrier with me and it shouldve been under the seat, but she advertised it in such a loud horrible way that i was absolutely shocked how she went about the whole ordeal. She blurted out that it was against FAA law that pet carriers have to be under the seat which is acceptable and understandable, but the way she approached this could have been dealt in a less aggressive attitude. I am so appalled with her attitude that I will choose not to fly with this airline again. I am from New Zealand and have flown with this airline before and now I will tell everyone I know not to fly this carrier. Ive decided to cancel my advantage membership as well. She should have taken note of the other attendant who asked \"nicely\" to push it a little further under the seat. I mentioned to the old grumpy attendant she could’ve said it nicely and her angry reply was \"I did.\" She also spoke like that to another passenger behind me. I heard Delta is a very good airline. I don’t care how much more I have to pay for any carrier, i wont be flying AA again and believe me I shall be searching out airline reviews online and \"spread the word\" about the atrocious treatment by this person. Its a shame one person can have such an effect on the entire airline. Just so sad!! Cabin service I would give 0.  All of our flights during our trip were on time or early arrival. My bag was ripped during our trip to DR but I reported after returning and I heard within a few days that AA would be sending me a check for the amount that I estimated the bag which was fairly new was worth.   Omaha to Los Angeles. I wanted to thank the American Airlines staff. I face many health issues and fly with my emotional support dog and in many cases they have went above and beyond to help me. Today they kindly asked someone to switch seats with me as they had more leg room for my dog. This is something I was not expecting as my dog and I make it work each time. The person was not very happy but I appreciated it more than they both will ever know. I always choose American Airlines and this is an example of why they stand out.  I was trying to fly home to San Diego from the San Antonio airport in Texas, and my experience with American Airlines was an absolute nightmare. First, my flight to Dallas was delayed by six hours, and then it was canceled. I was rescheduled for a new flight, which was also canceled. This happened five times in total. Eventually, I had to book a new flight directly with Delta Airlines just to get home. The final rescheduled flight by American Airlines was also canceled, causing me to miss two days of work. I was stuck in the airport for hours, which was torture. To make matters worse, one of the customer representatives lied about the airplane not being at the airport for one of the canceled flights. Using a flight tracker, I could see that the plane was indeed at the airport, and I could even see it outside the window. This experience was beyond frustrating and unacceptable. Save yourself the trouble and avoid flying with American Airlines at all costs.   Worst Airline ever. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 7:05, was delayed 5 different times, we all boarded the plane finally at 9:30 and have been sitting on the plane until now which is 10:37 with no reason why, many other passengers are upset/irritated. We will never fly American Airlines again.   My flight from Dallas to Vegas was delayed to the next morning and I had to stay overnight without any toiletries, which happens and is understandable. What is not understandable is the way American Airline\\'s incompetent staff handled their passengers\\' inquiries! One passenger, a young single mother holding her baby, approached a staff member to ask if she could get a change of diapers from her checked luggage, since she wasn\\'t expecting to stay overnight, her baby\\'s diaper was full, and she didn\\'t want him to develop a rash. This poor woman was on the verge of tears, but that didn\\'t hinder the staff member from callously and aggressively scolding her for putting the diapers in checked. Don\\'t get me wrong - I get how hard it is to pull luggage out of checked, it could take hours to an indeterminate amount of time. But there is a way to deliver even the grimmest news, and that way is respectfully, graciously, and compassionately. When the mother asked, \"What should I do, then?\" The staff member simply stared at her and dismissively replied, \"We don\\'t handle that here,\" turning to another staff member so that she didn\\'t have to \"deal\" with the passenger. When the passenger continued asking, breaking down into tears, the staff member just continued repeating the same nonchalant, monotonic answer, like a robot. She did this until the passenger, emotional and frustrated, finally left with her baby. I personally did not engage in any confrontation or dialogue with this staff member, nor did I have to ask for her name, but in the short time that I waited for my hotel voucher, I was appalled to see the same situation repeat with an elderly woman who asked about medication for a major illness. Needless to say, I will be avoiding American Airlines at all costs in the future, as well as spreading the word where I can. Any airline capable of carrying out such exceedingly poor hiring decisions is not worthy of anyone\\'s money and time.   Horrible company. They changed the gate three times, you had to run everywhere in the airport. They have zero organization, one big screen, and only a small line for information. You paid for an extra seat and they gave you a bad seat in exchange. American Airlines already has problems with flights and incidents, but when you see the service on the ground, it\\'s exactly the same.   I fly American Airlines a couple times a month because they are the only option in my small town. The customer service is beyond terrible! I have problems with almost every flight and can never get customer service. I\\'ve spent hours on the phone and in emails trying to get assistance to no avail. Garbage airline with people that treat customers like trash.   The banality of bad service is impressive. You book a flight, you can’t pick a seat, after you call them directly you’re put on a +4 hr wait list (which then they think it’s appropriate to call you at midnight), the online help option is useless, and so on… What else is there to say about this airline that hasn’t already been said.  I typically flew for work multiple times a month, and after my latest experience with their inability to even provide the service they offer, I’ve already made plans to use other airlines rather than keep a sorry excuse for an airline in the industry.  Flew to Boston from DFW one way. No delays on outbound flight. The flight was very smooth with very little turbulence encountered. Kudos to the flight crew - very polite and friendly. Kudos to American Airlines. The premium economy seat had plenty of legroom. Service is typical (biscotti, snack and soft drinks) of all domestic flights. ICE worked just fine. American does a pretty good job of getting you were you want on their domestic flights.  Horrible! The flight took off late because of “traffic” on the runway. They arrived to Dallas in time, but didn’t let us get off the plane until it was just enough time to miss the connecting flight. How? If when booking the flight they give you the connecting flight. It doesn’t matter if you get to the airport hours early if they’re just going to run late themselves and make you miss your flight.   After a night of delay after delay, our flight to Barbados was canceled last night. Very lame excuses were given. We have the pilot and co-pilot but we don’t have a crew. We have a crew and pilot but the plane have to be boarded in 15 min. We can’t leave there is a curfew. The pilot can’t fly the plane now because of his contract. I have flown on third world airlines that are more competent than this. On a 4 day trip thanks to American Airlines wasted two days. I will make sure everyone that I know know this story   I will never recommend American Airlines! I was in the airport since 0630 on time for 0730 boarding to New York and connect to Minneapolis. However my flight cancelled and rescheduled twice which made me miss my work. I was supposed to be at work in Minneapolis at 1930. I planned my flight giving plenty of time to myself. I was hopeful to get home after 7 hr to the the latest for my night shift. All I did is seat from airport to another airport and suffer all day Monday. I finally flew from DC to Charlotte at 1:55 pm and landed around 3pm. Only option I was given is to wait till 10:56 pm flight to land at 12:37 am for extra expenses. Stop by to the customer service and asked if I can get meal voucher which took her about 30 min and even being accused for verbally threatening for her because I asked her information/I’d. she told me connecting plane was on time and told me that is my fault for not being in the right place and “we only offer one meal voucher per day” what? Ironically it was not under my control for the airlines canceling my planned flight several times a day. I have to say that I got $12 meal voucher in DC airport for the morning and she finally gave me $12 for lunch. I also have to be punished at work for calling in for 8hr night shift and lose my sick time/money for me. I am very disappointed for the whole process and end up being physically/mentally/ emotionally and financially to be drained and my time is taken away from my family. I filled a complaint online and I was rewarded 2500 mile for 11 hours of delay from my original ticket and 11 hrs of hustle and bustle - what a joke.   Our flight was canceled in New York to Miami. After hours of trying to find another flight we ended up paying $1800 and flew United to Orlando, rented a car and drove to Miami. We were awake for 26 hours before reaching our destination. This was over a month ago and still haven’t received a refund. I have called customer service countless times and still no refund. The app they keep referring me to doesn’t work and they refuse to issue my refund over the phone. I’ve been hung up on and sent down many rabbit hole from customer support. My wife and I do a lot of traveling however we will never fly American Airlines again. I have never had this much trouble with any airline. I don’t usually leave reviews however I’m hoping this can save someone from the trouble we have experienced.   Salt Lake City to Dallas Ft Worth. Our flight was supposed to depart Salt Lake at 1:39. It was delayed until 5:30 because of mechanical issues and then the crew had to be swapped out because of the pilots hours and a new crew had to be located and flown in to fly the plane. On the original part of the trip, this same thing occurred leaving Dallas to Salt Lake and we were two hours delayed, but that crew was able to switch planes with us. I will never fly American again. They are zero for two of my experience. They don’t even appear bothered by it as it seems they are used to this type of problems.  The aircraft and especially with the pandemic is very dirty. The bathroom floors were filled with pee just before takeoff. When I told the crew member he sarcastically responded that if I want they can delay the flight take off and clean the bathrooms! I tried to talk about his rudeness to another member and she proceeded to yell at me. Thankfully the woman infant of me acknowledged the rudeness and I just let it be. But, with crew shortages and this pandemic it seems they all have a listened for being rude and a part of me now understands why there has been so many brawls with customers. The crew is utterly entitled to being rude to everyone as they have become a rare commodity with so much shortages I suppose.   American airlines has the worst customer service. Before boarding They say they allow only 1 cabin bag, and despite having empty cabin space in the flight they force you to check in your cabin baggage at the gate.  They threaten you to not board and take another flights and pay fare difference. They don’t monitor people and those who get in early with more than one allowed carry on and they force people who get in later to check in the carryon without even verifying properly if there is cabin space or not.  Very annoyed with American Airlines. I have been requesting my money back for my trip for 2 years now. My trip was canceled when the pandemic started and all they keep doing is postponing the expiration date. I work in healthcare and it is not easy to just go travel when we are still in a pandemic. I cannot believe their policy as the email I received when the flight was canceled on their end stated I can get my money back or have a credit. 2 years later and here I am with a credit I cannot use!   I had the absolute worst flight experience of my life. My first flight took 2 hours to leave the ground, once I got off the flight I was notified that my connecting flight to get to Albany was delayed 12 hours because the crew never showed up. The service was horrendous and I did not even receive an apology from workers. I got a hotel voucher which was a run down disgusting hotel and was given a food voucher for \"dinner\", which was 12 dollars, I ended up rebooking my flight with a different airline because the same flight that was delayed 12 hours, was not even guaranteed to leave during the announced delay time. If I had waited I would have been stuck in Charlotte on Thanksgiving day when I had very limited time to see my family. The flight back was even worse. My first flight also almost took two hours to leave the ground so by the time I got off my first flight my next flight was boarding. I had to run from terminal F to terminal B, and made it there 17 minutes before the flight left and I was rudely shooed away and told that the doors were closed even though the flight was still there. There were many people on my connecting flight that were also shooed away. I was sobbing my eyes out from the stress, I needed to get back to my car which would have been towed if I did not make it back on time. I received no apologies, no accommodations. When I went to talk to someone about this issue they were extremely rude and quickly rebooked me a new flight and told me \"you better run if you want to make it on time\" after I ran 20 minutes to try to make my first connecting flight. I received no apologues, workers were disturbingly rude. Service was horrendous. I received no refund or vouchers after this hellish experience, where I have had other airlines send refunds and vouchers without me asking. I will be telling everyone about this horrible experience and I will never fly American airlines again. Truly the worst experience.  American Airlines, where do I start? Always a delay. Delay in baggage. Had to wait literally an hour for baggage. Delay in flight. Always \\'another aircraft blocking\\'. Probably the worst airline I have ever flown.   After my family boarded our flight, the pilot taxied down the runway then returned to the airport to get more fuel, citing weather. Flight delay caused us to miss our connecting flight. The boarding counter agent told us the flight was delayed so the crew could rest. I shared with him the reason given by the pilot and he again stated that it was so the crew could rest. I was thoroughly disturbed by this. Not to mention the meal vouchers we were given for our inconvenience weren\\'t honored at the food establishments we visited. We had to separate and fly on different additional connecting flights which took us an extra 8 hours to reach our destination. We missed all the events we had planned for our trip\\'s first day and this cut our trip extremely short. Not sure I\\'ll book with this airline again, money wasted!   We sat on the tarmac for 2 hours waiting on American to load general cargo on our flight from Miami to Puerto Rico. They initially said they had a problem with the “baggage” handler. I’m in transportation and all of these passenger planes carry additional cargo. It’s big money for them. As we went to leave the pilot said he had to sign off on the paperwork for all of the cargo. Once again, corporate America selling out profits over their people. And they lie because they know it’s wrong.  I flew twice (meaning roundtrip) this past week on American. They definitely are not being overly cautious about the coronavirus. We sat 6 across on our jet, with no space between each other, every seat filled on one of my flights. On the first flight, many seats were empty, but customers were crowded together within about a 5 row block.   I will never fly American Airlines again. Somehow this airline managed to delay 1 of my 2 check bags both ways. I can understand an accidental bag delay once, but twice?!?! So on my arrival to the Dominican Republic one of my checked bags was sent to another city and I had to wait 4 days to receive it. Then upon arriving home, it happened again! On my return trip home, I needed wheelchair service due to having had recent surgery and the inability to walk long distances. Upon arrival to Miami, I had approx 1.5 hours before my connecting flight left. I explained this to the attendant who was pushing me in a wheelchair. The attendant assured me that I would make my flight. They rolled me away from the gate and to a waiting electric cart where I waited 15 min, then drove me to a holding area where there were approximately 45 ppl waiting to taken by wheelchair to customs. I asked the new staff member at the counter could I please receive help as my flight would be leaving in less than an hour and I needed assistance to get to customs, baggage claim, recheck my bags, and get to my gate. He looked at my ticket and told me that I wouldn’t make my flight. I told him that my plane had not yet started boarding and if I could get hello I’m certain that I could make it. At this time, I asked to speak to a manager. The manager arrived about 5 min later. She speaks to the staff in Spanish and then comes over and starts explaining to me why I was going to miss my flight. She was very argumentative and was clearly not concerned about me missing my flight. In fact, she seemed to take delight in explaining to me all the reasons why I wouldn’t make it. All the while 4 staff members with 3 wheelchairs and an electric cart are standing around listening to her. I politely cut her off and tell her while you are standing here wasting time telling me all the reasons why I’m going to miss my flight, you could be helping me try to get there. I asked her if one of these staff members could take me where I need to be, now. She speaks to them at length in Spanish and one of them tells me to get into a wheelchair where they continue speaking In Spanish (mind you, all of these employees speak English but are speaking Spanish to one another over my head). Finally an employee takes me via wheelchair through customs and to baggage claim where he speaks in Spanish to the attendant there and tells me to get out of the wheelchair. The attendant there stops him and says you can’t leave her here because I don’t have any help. The man who pushed me says in English that she told him to push me there and leave me. I ask the attendant at baggage claim to please help me. I’m trying to make my flight that leaves in 30 minutes. I can’t miss it because there’s not another flight out. He looks at the guy pushing me and says “just help her man”. He then leaves his post and a assists the guy pushing me in getting my luggage and directs him to the check point. Thank God for the employee in baggage claim. If it weren’t for him, I def wouldn’t have made it. I was able to get through security fairly quickly by being in the wheelchair. I had a final obstacle to get through but eventually made it with few minutes to spare. It upset me greatly how unconcerned and unhelpful the majority of the staff was. I will never give this airline my money again!   I haven’t flown American Airlines in years and while there was excellent customer service peppered in, the cons outweighed it for this low star review. We thought it odd that we couldn’t use the kiosks to check in nor could we sit together. There were delays in every leg of travel. The lines were very long and not moving on the return. Half the kiosks were down. The only customer service was the kiosk curbside agent, who expected a tip.   Another good experience on American. This 10 hour flight was very comfortable and I was happy with all the elements. Flagship lounge was great, food was quite good and the service was efficient and very friendly. Only complaint is the entertainment system which had plenty of content but awkward to use with many unresponsive moments. All in all, in my experiences these last two flights, American is upping their premium game.   I arrived at the very small AA check-in station in the Wichita Falls airport thirty minutes before my flight\\'s departure time. There was no one at the computer and no way to summon anyone. I waved at some AA employees behind a glass wall but they would not acknowledge me. I could not go through security without a boarding pass and there was no one to give me a boarding pass. After I was turned away and went back home i lodged a complaint. They answered that there was a \"check-in cutoff time,\" after which the computer will not allow anyone else to be checked in. I believe it would be a good thing if the \"check-in cutoff time\" were advertised, or at least publicly posted, as this is the first I have ever heard of such a thing. I understand that there comes a minute when the planes doors are being shut. I understand the need for security measures, time consuming though they may be. But since there is apparently a specific moment in time after which \" the computer system automatically restricts the ability to check any passenger in for the flight,\" I feel that this fact ought to be known by everyone. Perhaps it could even be noted on the ticket for each flight. I understand that people are advised to arrive early and I understand why. I followed a link they provided that was supposed to provide information about the \"computer cutoff time.\" If it is mentioned anywhere on AA\\'s website it is buried someplace. I would also like to reiterate that, at this small, unbusy airport--if I could only have received a boarding pass--I could have casually strolled through security checkpoint, walked unhurriedly to the boarding area, and joined the line of other people who were still boarding the plane. The only problem was the unmanned reception desk caused by this \"check-in cutoff time\". There was no, to me, (and I am a reasonable person) obvious logistical problem that would have prevented all required security measures from being observed and yet still allowed me to board and find my seat with a quarter of an hour or more to spare before the doors were closed. Even though I was only half an hour early instead of a full hour early, in this small venue, I can\\'t help but believe that the fault for my denial of a boarding pass lies with AA\\'s organizational structure rather than with failure on my part.   Layovers won\\'t accommodate just a little time to get to the next flight when they are the ones causing the delay. (only 4 minutes- layover is now 5 hours instead of 30 minutes) Staff is rude and clearly deals with this all the time and just doesn\\'t care. They are dismissive and unprofessional. I honestly don\\'t know how this airline stays in business. Unfortunately the flights home are this horrific airline. I\\'d rather drive at this point. Would get there earlier.   What a disappointment. It’s almost unreal how bad this flight and customer service was. Not only was our first AA flight delayed 40 minutes for “maintenance paperwork” but then the connecting flight was either not told or didn’t care that the original flight was late, so more than a dozen people sprinted through DFW only to arrive at the gate 10 minutes before takeoff and be told (even though the plane was still there) that the gate closed five minutes ago and there “was nothing they could do.” Not only is that not true it is not helpful. Speaking of not helpful, rebooking a flight was completely driven by me - no one offered to help all of the stranded people at DFW who missed their connections (again due to AA being late, not us). I ended up flying back to Austin because there were no additional flights for more than 12 hours. On that flight, I was shocked to learn that we were waiting 30-40 more minutes so that “we can get everyone to Austin we can because this is the last flight.” What? Where was this idea of waiting - regardless of people on board - for all of the people on our first AA flight that missed their last flight of the day to their final destination? Absolutely surreal. I will never fly AA again and I will absolutely recommend to everyone I speak to to avoid this airline.   We took a round-trip international 3 connection flight schedule from Charlotte to JFK to Helsinki to Kattila, Finland. The flights that we had with American Airlines departed late and caused undue stress on our family\\'s travels plans. When we spoke with multiple American Airlines employees they were all very rude especially in the JFK terminal 8 area. I\\'m also confused how our flight was scheduled to depart at 06.00am but didn\\'t depart until over an hour late especially when there was no reported weather or mechanical issues. Matter of fact the plane was parked at the departure gate for 6 hours prior to the scheduled departure. Than when we boarded the plane my spouse asked if they had any alcohol cleaning wipes because of COVID-19, the flight attendant said that they were out. I think this was a lie because this was the first flight of the day for this crew and plane. Lastly it is very disappointing that the AA policy regarding military boarding priority is only for active duty members that are in uniform. When many of the other airlines honor military personnel both active duty and retired members.   I have flown AA many times pre-COVID, and never had any complaints. My husband and I recently flew to Cancun and were extremely disappointed in the whole experience. The flight was changed just a couple of weeks before we were due to leave from a 5am flight to an 8am flight. This had us landing sometime just before 7pm Cancun time. After customs and getting a rental car we didn’t get to the resort until after 9pm. The entire day was wasted. I always schedule the 5 am so we can have a few hours to enjoy before retiring for the night. This time however had us rushing to get dinner before the restaurant closed up for the night. Getting back to the flight though. The flight was 45 minutes late taking off due to some important maintenance not getting done ahead of time. That gave us less than a half hour to catch our connecting flight, so we were unable to get something to eat between flights. Needless to say, by the time we got to our destination, we were quite hangry. The fight, both from Portland to Dallas and from Dallas to Cancun were completely full, so social distancing was a joke. This will most definitely be the last time I will ever fly AA again.   We arrived at Miami 30 minutes early and sat waiting to un board for over 30 mins. When I finally got off the plane to connect with my transfer to NY, the flight was delayed 30 minutes. The flight was scheduled to depart at 9pm and the time is currently 9.40 and we’re still boarding. When I finally get to my seat, there is no TV’s. Won’t be flying American Again.   From the start of our trip leaving San Antonio, connecting in Phoenix for final leg to Durango, along with our return flight from Durango with connecting flight in DFW to San Antonio I experienced consistent attitude, rudeness, and impolite tone of voice and facial expressions from the gate agents. They refused to acknowledge I was standing in front of them, never even engaging me with an “I’ll be with you momentarily”. We encountered delays on two of my for legs and not a single recognition of the inconvenience, as if we are just supposed to put up with it. They acted like government employees who cared nothing about the ‘customer’ and knew there’d be no accountability for their terrible care for the customer.   The worst customer service. AA is delayed on every flight. It’s getting absolutely ridiculous. I waited in line for 30 minutes only for them to tell me call the airline we can’t help you because we are short staffed. We were rebooked twice and the next flight is delayed too. Now placed on a waiting list. Very unhappy with this airline.   There is absolutely no reason why in 2022 a customer can\\'t get a full refund with sufficient notice of a cancelation. Its September 29 and my trip was for Feb 28th 2023. My dog needs a $12,000 surgery. This wasn\\'t planned for obviously. Neither airline was understanding. I understand it says no refunds as soon as you book but honestly the airlines are just money hungry. Life happens. Help the people out. Like I said, with sufficient time, we all deserve a full refund. It\\'s not like I canceled a day before and expect it.   I was made to check my bag. I’ve been on ten different flights with same bag. No issues with size. Never flying with American again. Rude and obstinate. \\xa0\\xa0Absolute trash of an airline. Constantly delayed flights. Ticket reps could not care less.   They made traveling with children very stressful. We were the last group to board, they never called for families with car seats or children to board first. While boarding both flights, I felt like we were bumping everyone with our car seats and struggled installing the car seats. Our flight out of Philly was smooth, however our flight out of Pensacola was not. The woman working the counter gave me a hard time about the diaper bag, which per their policy online does not count as a carry on. She kept telling me I had 1 too many bags. I argued saying I don’t understand their policy states it does not count as a carry on, and I had zero problems when I flew out from Philly. She finally told me to just go. Then once we were boarded, there was maintenance needed on the wing, which delayed us an hour. I know this is of nobody’s fault, but since boarding was such a hassle I already was upset and was so nervous we’d have to unload the children. Thankfully we didn’t have to. After my experience, I am going to try to avoid flying American Airlines if I have the option.   Avoid like the plague. First flight cancelled for lack of crew. Second flight, four hours later rerouted to Atlanta, three hours from destination. That flight was cancelled for maintenance issues. No other flights available. Tried to book us for a flight two days later automatically. More than an hour and a half wait time to get to customer service. Ruined our first holiday vacation in a year and a half. They do not have the crews or staff to meet their flight schedules and are proactively cancelling almost 100 flights every day because they don\\'t have the crews. And, checked baggage was still sent to Atlanta despite the flight being cancelled. Never fly American Airlines -- let them fail and the other airlines take up the slack.   \\r\\nHorrible airline. Customer Service people at the gate were rude and condescending. I only had a small carry on and small luggage. Made me check my bag. Even though it fit into their check bag display. I don\\'t care if it was for free I wanted to keep my bag with me th3 reason why I brought it. Of course you can\\'t refuse because that causes a whole other cascade of events. They even went to go so far as to say they will run out of gas. Really that\\'s what you tell passengers who are about to fly. Run out of gas from Chicago to New York. What are you flying on 1/4 gas tank or something. I\\'m upset my tax dollars bailed them out. I never fly them because they have a history of being rude. The only reason why I went with them this time because it was less that 300 dollars for a round trip. flight from Sfo to NY. Would I fly them again for the same price, maybe, but only of it is extremely cheap. If its market rate. I rather pick Southwest at least their nice or Delta.   This is only the second time I\\'ve flown in my life and I\\'m 65 years old. I have a broken back, asked for wheelchair assistant when ordered tickets but In TRI cities they were great on top of everything. But coming and going to LAX. Charlotte Airport American airlines was no help at all. I had to walk both trips for 20 min ... couldn\\'t find anyone to help me get wheelchair and i was in so much pain I thought I was going to have to call rescue squad. Very unprofessional.   So disappointed with American Airlines. I booked a two stops flight overseas. They first rescheduled the flight to three stops, now they said the return flights are four stops! I am stuck and customer service did not even try to help or even apologize for the inconvenience This is unacceptable. Please think twice before choosing American Airlines.   Wonderful experience with this airline! We flew on Christmas Day. It was a busy day at the gate and the plane was full. Every member of the staff that I encountered was friendly and helpful. I was traveling with my elderly parents and wasn’t made to feel like a burden or a hassle. Our originally booked economy seats (which were not all together) were upgraded at the gate to first class! And we got to sit next to each other! The patience and kindness of the attendants with my folks who are hard of hearing and need things repeated several times made the trip very calming and relaxing. The service aboard the aircraft was top notch. The attendants were in the Christmas spirit in spite of having to work and passed out candy to all with a cheerful greeting. I was relieved to be traveling on an airline that was so accommodating and friendly. Thank you!  I and my family used AA on June 15th due to Southwest canceling a lot of flights due to a computer issue. We booked the same day and the flight was delayed from 4.33pm to 6 something PM to 7.30pm. This caused us to miss our connecting flight in Dallas that left at 10.40pm but we did not land till closer to midnight. We were told by the ramp agent we would get vouchers for hotel, transportation and a meal when we got to Dallas. Imagine our surprise when we got to Dallas there were no customer service agents to get the vouchers. I attempted to call AA customer service was on hold for over a hour, no one ever picked up. Everything was closed in regards to food, etc.. There was no one to assist us. I am a diabetic, my blood sugar dropped drastically. I am upset that AA airlines think that 5000 travel miles compensates us for this inconvenience. I basically told them this and they then offered me 100.00 voucher. I always use AA but after the way it was handled I will be looking at other airlines going forward.   Courtney was the best flight attendant I have ever had. Very courteous, friendly and you could tell loved her job. She made sure you had a great flight   My flights were cancelled once. The airline booked it again. As we were boarding the flight on the next day, the flight was cancelled again. So I decided to get a rental car and drive 12h just to make sure I\\'d eventually reach my destination. They refunded $20 of a $140 tickets. No compensation for hotels or rental car whatsoever. Very unhelpful on the phone.  Started in Greenville our original flight was canceled after getting to the airport at 3:30 AM. Next day we flew to Charlotte which was supposed to fly into Miami our flight was delayed so our seats we payed to upgrade where given away as we stood at the gate, American gave my wife and I a hotel in Charlotte which was a drug motel blood and pubic hair littered the sheets half a chicken nugget was beside the bed. We left the hotel and had to Uber and then pay to stay in a hotel we both felt safe in the next morning we took Uber to the airport flew into Miami they gave our bags to baggage claim instead of our connecting flight so we had to rush to the baggage claim had to repay to get our bags through be put on rush to get back to our plane so we finally made it to St Lucia for our honey moon and here I sit with nothing but the clothes on my back because American Airlines lost my suitcase, so I appreciate them for ruining my honeymoon.   I\\'ve flown 5 times on AA planes in the past week and they are truly their own worst enemy. Here\\'s what you need to do AA: Hire enough staff to actually staff the flights you book, train them well, and fairly compensate them for their difficult and stressful labor that they do for you - especially the workers who have to work outside the air-conditioned planes and the air-conditioned buildings. If you understaff then your customers have terrible experiences like I did. It\\'s not these individual employee\\'s faults the vast majority of the time; it\\'s you the company. Don\\'t book flights in planes that don\\'t work properly. Don\\'t book more flights than you can responsibly staff. And don\\'t check everyone\\'s carryons at the gate if you\\'re not going to get those bags back to us in a timely manner. Don\\'t give me the seats I want, confirm them, and then bump me because someone else wanted to pay you a few dollars more. Scrambling will frustrate everyone. Do better.   I have flown with over 20 airlines in business and my flight was easily the worst I have ever experienced. The staff do not appear to want to be working! In business they stuffed economy passengers luggage in my overhead. The flight from New Orleans to Dallas in first class was 90 minutes and they served a bag of peanuts only! Avoid at all cost. I will avoid them at all cost! No wonder their rating is 2/10. I think that is generous.   Flight from Columbus to Dallas was delayed by 8 hours. Communication and assistance to customers was fairly good. A food voucher to cover a meal during the long wait in Columbus would have been helpful. A flight attendant on the flight from Dallas to Guadalajara did not speak Spanish and was very rude to passengers who did not speak English.  American is the worst airline I have ever flown and will never fly here again. I had a flight at 2:50ish on a Thursday. We get a delay, then another delay until it’s delayed until the next morning where the flight was suppose to depart at 8:00am. I’m here at 6:30 and then we get another delay to 10:30, then we get another delay to 4:00pm. I’ve checked out of my hotel, have now wasted well over 24 hours and more money I didn’t want to spend but had to. Turns out there’s something wrong with the plane window and they don’t have the parts in Fort Lauderdale to fix it so they had it shipped what the guy initially said Miami, now he’s saying the parts aren’t even in the state. No one could have the decency to issue reimbursements, vouchers, nothing, to the people they’ve screwed over for this flight. One lady had to see someone before that person died and they said there was nothing they could do cause all the flights to Chicago were sold out on every other airline as well. The incompetence of this airline will go down in every story I ever casually talk about flying. Shame on you this airline. You’ve lost a customer. Will never spend another dime with you all because of this awful experience.  Using Covid as an excuse for serving tasteless sandwiches and drinks in plastic glasses, offering no pillows, no pre departure drinks etc in first class is getting old. We all know this is purely about money and not safety any longer. Flight attendants are embarrassed and it’s not their fault. I flew today on a beautifully appointed international aircraft for this 3 hour flight but service was minimal. In addition the first class cabin screens are ridiculously positioned and difficult to see. Prices remain at a premium level and the services can safely be offered and should be. Fix this before premium customers find a carrier that offers premium service.   During my travels from Arizona to Ohio in October, my custom luggage tag was lost. It wasn\\'t expensive but a very cute, rubber dog shaped luggage tag. Two months later, I received an envelope from an employee of American airlines returning my tag. He stated they found it on the tarmac and wanted to return it. The return address was his personal address with postage paid, I assume by the employee. I found this this gesture extremely kind and thoughtful. He went out of his way to return the tag (even send a new strap). Bravo for customer service.   If you are traveling across the United States, do not take this airline. There were so many delays for the revisits or go back home. The recent airplane we are in there was no AC, the pilots were missing and our 11:00pm flight was delayed to the point we have to wait until 6:00am to arrive back home. If you want to travel, you’re better off taking another airline.  Terrible service, unprofessional, and did nothing to help passengers get new flights or fix any issues. Planes were more than an hour delayed, service was awful, and maybe some of the rudest staff you’ll ever meet. Safe yourself the trouble the next time you travel and use any other carrier besides American.   American Airlines is the worst. I am a loyalty member and I regret it completely. This is the second time this year my flight was delayed and I missed my connecting flight. I have wasted a lot of money and time on American Airlines. I do not recommend anyone to use AA.com. I had to stay over night in a strange city with my kids. I huge hassle. I received vouchers that were not excepted because all restaurants are closed so they are completely useless. I am canceling my loyalty membership immediately.   Flight was delayed for over 3 hours. Lost my bag and did not get any customer service for over 24 hours with multiple attempts and trips back to the airport. Nobody was at the ticket counters.   I had planned a trip to Mexico for me and 2 friends. Covid hit and they cancelled our flight and closed the border. I called the airline and they said they would refund my money or keep the tix on file. I chose the latter. Fast forward a year and a half and the place still has quarantine restrictions. I called the airline for a refund and the snotty attendant said they do not give refunds but I have a credit that will expire in March. He acted like he was doing me a favor because he said in normal times the credit is only good for a year. I asked to speak to someone about a refund and he said there is no one you have to email. I paid for 3 tix on my credit card and this guy told me I would only get a credit for one because the tix were in individual names. Even though he could see that all three were paid for on my card. I asked him how I would get this resolved and he said we would all have to file a claim individually. I tried to be patient and explain that wouldn\\'t be possible but he cut me off to say that was the only way. He didn\\'t let me finish to say that my one friend is deceased. When I told him he said it didn\\'t matter I would still have to follow the refund procedure online. I went to the online refund site and there is no way to put in a refund for multiple tickets and they ask you for comments but it gets cut off after so many words. In summary I think they know exactly what they are doing, they are making it so hard that you give up and they just keep your money. I waited on hold for over 2 hours and then hung up. I called back and got in the call back system at 9 am and got a call back in the late afternoon.  Pretty good service. To make this clear, I am a minor and used the UNMR (the service for minors traveling alone). The flight attendants from LIM-MIA were a bit strict, but eh. It happens sometimes. The room where I was in was great, and the attendants were also quite nice. The next two trips (other than a nerve-wracking delay) went fine, and I was moved up to the top-tier seat at the final flight (granted, it was a 30 minute flight but they had a lot of amenities for that). Food was decent, but the IFE had something to wish for, mostly because there was little to no IFE onboard the two flights that would be expected to have.   Took an American Airlines flight to Hawaii in January for a long awaited trip. I have never been so berated or treated so indecent by the staff on this flight. For 6 hours they continuously announced \\'sip and replace\\' your mask. Refused to give me a fork and knife to eat my salad (luckily I found a plastic travel ware I had) gave us only 1 beverage service on a 6+ hour flight and then tried to deny more water. When I had dropped something between the seats and my man tried to dig below and in the fumble his mask slipped a little below his nose instantly the attendant was like \\'sir, your mask\\'. Are you serious?  If you are going to have a customer facing staff please coach them on how to be kinder to your customers. Unfortunately I won\\'t be able to fly American again and have cancelled my 6 years in use AAdvantage card. Goodbye American!  Springfield to Columbia via Charlotte. I flew out on March 31 from Springfield MO to Charlotte NC and then on to Columbia SC. I got a phone call in the middle of the night to return home on the 2nd of April due to my mother being placed on life support. We tried to call and change my flight from Monday to Saturday morning. Stayed on hold for over 2 hours with another approximate 6 hours of hold time to go. I went ahead and bought another ticket to get me home since I could be back in Missouri before your hold time was up. Called on Sunday to get a refund and cancel my Monday flights. No refund! And here is the really funny part - airline credit but I have to use it from Columbia SC airport when I live in Missouri. No wonder you are ranked in the bottom 3. I will never fly American Airlines again and although the $400.00 was nothing to you, it was something to me.   I had a flight from San Jose Costa Rica to Indianapolis with a connection in Miami. I had to go through customs and reclaim my bags before going to IND. My flight arrived at 8:04 with the next flight at 9:17. Got through immigration at 8:24. Bags didn\\'t arrive until 8:56 and when I tried to re check them they said it was too late you and you can\\'t make your flight. When I went to customer service they said the next days flights are all booked up there was no way to get from Miami to Indianapolis for another day and a half. No refunds, not even a bag fee. I had to buy ticket on Delta for $600 to get home. When I called customer service the wait was 8 hrs to get a person. This is by far the worst airline ever. In the last few years I have slept in more airports because of AA than I care to have. Do not fly this airline.   Absolute nightmare of a trip, we are first delayed 5 hrs in 30 minute increments with various reasons for the delay. Then when they cancel the flight at 130, they push it 24 hrs and won\\'t but people on the earlier flight leaving the next day. Give us hotel vouchers that are in Brooklyn, a 40 min drive, and when you call the taxi on the voucher they say 1-2 hour wait because there not ready for 200 people at the same time. So I show up the next day 24 hours later and another hour delay because the plane isn\\'t ready.   Do not fly American Airlines. I had three flights canceled within two weeks. These cancellations were announced within hours of the flight taking off. I missed my brothers wedding. Then I decided to fly my brother out and both of his flights were canceled - resulting in missed days of work and multiple trips to the airport for both of us. American Airlines is very unprofessional.   Flight canceled after 6 hours of postponed and waiting until crew was gone, midnight, everything in airport closed, gate attendants were supposed to rebook flights, hotel vouchers, food vouchers but decided to walk away from counter. I had to book and pay all over again and sleep in baggage claim. I’m 51 7 spine surgeries, high anxiety and blood pressure, had no meds and still haven’t been able to speak to anyone   Worst flight experience to date. Flight kept getting moved all over then delay for 5 hours until they pushed it to the next morning. After that everyone had to stand in line for over 2 hours to get vouchers for a hotel and food, but the food voucher could barely afford a kids meal at the hotel. Hotel was the only option for food since all of the restaurants and shops were closed. Employees were yelling at customers who have been getting the run around for over 5 hours. No one answered any questions on how to use the vouchers nor did they do anything to speed along the process of giving out the vouchers. Ended up getting the run around for so long I just booked a different flight since they weren’t really doing anything to fix the issue aside from making everyone wait even longer for a vouchers that they hardly can use. Only customer service that gets made at you for you being upset and their bad service.  On Oct 17 Tuesday, I was supposed to take the 7:05 am flight from JFK to CUN, DIRECT FLIGHT. The ground staff from American Airlines told me my original flight AA1327 was delayed and time changed to 12 pm. I got there in the counter around 4 am without sleeping. I did not receive any notification nor email, he said he just knew it, so he offered me to fly to Charlotte to transit for my destination in Cancun arrives around 11:30am I did not want to wait for the 12pm flight so I accepted it. But I discovered my original flight-AA1327 was on schedule. I am hugely disappointed to American Airlines, as if this is a custom that the company usually does, just because I did not purchase premium tickets? Or the reason of overbooking passengers? What I only care and mind is, it gave me a big hassle taking off and taking on another flight. What\\'s more I trusted the information from their staff and I lost the trust in this company COMPLETELY and I would avoid flying with AA, because there\\'s no integrity, the staff did not disclosure the right information for me to make such decision and it\\'s intentional lying. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE   I have never been so disappointed with an airline service as I have been with American Airlines. This is one airline that I never wish to travel on but unfortunately the only flight available for us was AA. There has never been a time when they haven’t delayed their flights for hours. Last time we flew AA we kept getting delayed and rerouted. All the delays and extended layovers has always ruined our trip one way or the other. Our flights are delayed again today for 2 hrs and we we won’t be home until past midnight. We have to get home to our 11 month old daughter who isn’t feeling well and nothing can be done. AA doesn’t even have the decency to apologize properly to Theo customers for doing this every single time. This is extremely frustrating! We simply dont want to fly with AA again, and no giving us a flight credit will simply not solve the issue because we do not want to fly AA again.    Very disappointed with wheelchair assist. First flight Pittsburgh to Chicago excellent assist, also to Springfield on 7-09-24. Did change gate without notice, gate attendant did call for wheelchair assist. Coming home 7/13/24 ,the Springfield to Dallas flight was over an hour late, we arrived at Dallas after my plane to Pitt had left no wheelchair was waiting at the gate, attendant had to make several calls finally called her manager, finally wheelchair arrived. The assistant was very kind and took me to the help desk where I was able to book a flight To Pitt and he took me to the gate A17. Sitting there, they changed the gate to A8,,I walked from A17 to A8 because I wasn\\'t sure about waiting again for a wheelchair The flight was late taking off. It was a very stressful day the airline is very unorganized, lacks communication skills, only after I got home did I see that they had sent me E-mail regarding all the changes. The should text people. They also should be more aware of assisting those with mobility issues, that\\'s why I asked for assistance and it was scheduled for each flight. Not sure I will use this airline again.   Every time I fly from Charlotte with American Airlines I have a terrible experience. Very unprofessional, constant delays, hiccups with baggage claiming, and poor communication.   My family, which includes my 3 and 5 year old children, was flying from Chicago to Greenville. We strategically chose a nonstop flight because, as we all know, children and flying don’t always mix well. We were at our gate, the agent, who was a pleasant young man, was speaking over the intercom assuring us the flight will definitely take place. The plane pulls up, the pilot walks on, and the flight gets cancelled 4 minutes before boarding. They decide to go to Dayton instead. I then book it to the customer service line which is growing longer by the second. The agent at the counter tells me the BEST they can do is fly us to Raleigh at 11:30pm, arrive at 1:30am, wait seven hours to get on a 8:30am flight to DC, wait another three hours and go from DC to Greenville at 12:30, arriving at 2:30. We were supposed to be home Sunday night, now we have to sleep in an airport and get home the next afternoon?? And because it’s “weather related” you can’t offer us a hotel? This is borderline inhumane. We get to Raleigh at 1:30am, Raleigh airport kicks us out to do a security sweep. My 3 and 5 year old children are napping on a bench near baggage, waking up crying every 30 minutes, my husband is sleeping on the floor, and I’m up stewing. I get on the American Airlines website and I, a non-American-airlines-employee, find a flight from Raleigh to Charlotte and then from Charlotte to Greenville, getting us to Greenville by 8:30am. Why didn’t they offer this option in the first place? Why is it that I could do a better job than the agent I waited in a mile long line could do? And that’s not even the best part. We get home home and our luggage is lost. I will say that the agent at the lost baggage counter at GSP was amazing. She found our luggage, instructed me on how to track it so I could later see that, surprise surprise, my luggage would later be late again. But I eventually got my luggage so I can finally take a shower at 7pm. The original plan was to get home Sunday night at 11:30pm, sleep in, send the kids to daycare, and spent the rest of Monday getting our lives back together. But no, we all slept all day on Monday recovering from the abuse we endured all night thanks to American Airlines. Kids were up all night Monday night. Great times. Despite the horror stories I heard prior to the trip, I decided to follow through and give you the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately you have proven those stories to be accurate. 0/10 stars American. Extremely disappointing. Would not recommend.   Bridgetown to Raleigh. Do not fly with American. Unless you enjoy wasting time and money. In that case feel free. They provide terrible customer service, terrible support, they will destroy your luggage and waste your time. I have spent hours on the phone getting no where regarding my last experience flying from Barbados back home. Unfortunately, only American Airlines and JetBlue offered flights to Barbados from where I live. Next time I will be sure to fly JetBlue instead. They tore up my luggage on the first leg of the trip. This is a suitcase that I\\'ve used 3 times (this being the third time). We were in Barbados for a month and I needed all of my luggage. Typically my trips are shorter and do not require my largest suitcase. By the time we had landed, my wheel was basically hanging off and my bag was cracked at the bottom. This is not normal wear and tear as I have filmed their baggage people slamming our bags on the belt. On the return flight, they cancelled our connecting flight while we were in mid-air leaving us stranded with 8 large suitcases, no accommodation, in the middle of the night in another city. They had already cancelled the flights out for the next day and instead we tried to rent a thousand dollar rental last minute to get home. Unfortunately, the rental place told us they were out of cars due to the number of flights AA was cancelling. We went to another rental who it was rumored had cars - the line was wrapped around the building. We ultimately had to take an Uber ride home as AA left us no other options and no one would answer the customer support line. I could go on, but long story short. Save your money and fly with an airline that cares. I highly recommend Delta! Hopefully they will be adding Barbados back to their international travel list. But in this case, we should have booked with JetBlue. I would have rated them a 0, but since a 1 is the lowest, that is my rating.   I will never book with this airline again. I was supposed to travel to Phoenix for a conference. A few days before I was leaving with my friend her sister suffered a tragic death. I reached out to see what could be done and at first i was told nothing. Then after hearing the alderman\\'s of the situation they agreed to refund our tickets as long as I provided a death certificate, obituary and note on letter head from the funeral home stating the relationship of the deceased. Imagine the embarrassment of having to ask for these things when her and her family were grieving. Then even though I was told both tickets would be refunded they only refunded one. It\\'s shameful to think that this is how people treat another human in times of loss and grief. I hope who ever decides to process refunds never has the humiliation of what this company put me through. It\\'s shameful and they should be embarrassed to be a part of this company.   I had a six hour overnight from HNL, arrived at five in the morning only to find out they had cancelled my 9am flight. They booked my on a flight at 10.45 that night. That was over twelve hours later. So the supposed nine hour flight instead took over twenty four hours of grueling airport travel. They put me on the waitlist of a 1.30 pm and a 4.30 pm flight the same day, both times I sat at the gates for hours just to find both of those flights were overbooked and they had cancelled two flights to Denver that day, no reason given. The waitlist for each flight was over fifty people long. No refund/voucher of any type was given. I will never fly this flight again. Worst airline experience yet.   The flight was 8 hours long from New York to Rome, the plane was large but the legroom wasn’t much, the inflight entertainment was ok but there wasn’t many movies for the kids to choose. For dinner we ate chicken with veggies, we didn’t like it and for breakfast we ate a brownie and a bar. Not the highest quality experience but expect it in economy class.   This is the worst experience I’ve had on an airline. The language on their app I used to book my flight was unclear, which lead to me booking an incorrect ticket. When I called to correct the issue, the customer service representative hung up on me. I filed an inquiry through their website, and after ten days, I was given flight credit for a future flight. I will never book another flight through American Airlines.  In Dallas, we were completely loaded on the plane when pilot announced that a glass on the instrument panel was broken and had to be fixed. Did the pilots who just landed the plane not notice before they got off? Then they allowed us off the plane to try to get another flight. But first we had to wait in one line to \"put our name on a list\" then get in a second line to get a new ticket. What the heck was that for? Gate agents were not very helpful with questions.   All in all not a bad experience. The only issue was that AA does not allow online check-in when traveling with an infant. Therefore you cannot select your seats upfront unless you pay a high fee (100 euro per seat). This is a pity, especially when you want to make sure that the family seats together. Other airlines do this better. For the rest - relatively new 787 planes in the annoying 3-3-3 configuration which means that the seats are really narrow and you will barely fit. Service on board was good, flights were on time and smooth.   Baltimore to Charlotte. I was due to fly with American Airlines on March 27th. This was a reluctant purchase but the only airline that met my requirements. Previous experience has been less than favorable. Sadly due to President Trump\\'s ban on arrivals from the United Kingdom I am unable to travel to the USA. On top of that I have been put into self-isolation for my protection by my doctor. I contacted the airline and was refused a refund. They do not appear to see that presidential diktats and medical precautions are reasons not to travel on their airline. I appreciate that these days are fraught with uncertainty and things are perilous for the travel industry - they are the same for everyone. I find it surprising that such a major player will not treat its customer with fairness and sympathy. Should we ever risk buying a ticket with them again? An added point - I had extensive travel plans throughout the US on buses, trains and staying in hotels. I had pre-booked tickets. Only American Airlines have refused to countenance any recompense. It is sad to see. Please note - I have been forced to give 1 star regarding flight experience even though I have never been able to take this flight. So based on my experience with customer services I can only speculate that the in flight service would be equally as poor.   Worst experience ever. I bought a flight two months in advanced, pay for seats traveling with my family and they changed the aircraft. Did not respect seats, they separated the 4 of us and besides that sent our carry on to check in, still having space inside the plane. I expected not to check my bag going on a 7 day cruise, I got ready not to check any bag because I had previously lost a bag in my last trip and they did what they wanted to do. when I asked them for an explanation they said you can go or not if you want. That is not an answer for a passenger that had previously travel on the same airline many times. Very unprofessional, I am very dissatisfied And they need to return the money I paid for the seats   Flying this route quite frequently and what seems to be apparent: the food offering has improved markedly to 2023. As usual with AA: check in at Toronto was easy, pleasant, stress free. Boarding fast and efficient. Flight crew as expected from prior flights just phenomenal. All in all the flight on February 2nd AA1572 was perfect.   Do not fly American! My husband and I used 1 suitcase because it’s less for the airport to handle so our suitcase weighed 57 lbs. she said we had to pay $100 for the 7 lb overage or empty stuff out. Really? Now we were allowed 50 lbs each which is a total of 100 but because we consisted to one bag we were going to have to pay $100 or upgrade which was $93 each. Well we upgraded because at least we got something in return. The lady beside us stopped me as I walked away and basically told me the ticket lady did a number on us. I have flown Delta and United but tried American this time.Guard your wallet... they will get you   Terrible service. I was uncomfortable this entire flight due to the limited space in between seats. I\\'m 6\\'5 so I have longer legs than average, but I\\'ve never experienced the levels of discomfort I experienced on this flight. My legs were in the aisle the whole flight! Not to mention the attendants, practically yelling at me to put my legs in my seat when it was physically impossible. Poor service, poor comfort, never flying American Airlines ever again. Disgraceful airline. \\xa0 \\xa0American Airlines is extremely unprofessional, and does not hold up to their words. My family and I had a flight from Grand Junction, CO to Dallas, TX. After that, we had a connecting flight to Paris, France. Our flight to Grand junction was delayed from 4:30pm to 6:00pm. Meaning as soon as we landed now we would miss our connecting flight to France. We rescheduled our flight to Paris before even leaving Grand Junction. The man who helped us over the phone told us to contact the agents when we landed in Dallas, and that they would give us vouchers for our inconvenience. When we landed, we talked to the agents there who turned us away (and many others). The agent, in quote told us, “This is an act of god, to put it legally.” Because of the weather, we were denied a free hotel we were promised, or any vouchers for that matter. Why were we told we would be provided with this when we were completely shut down? The agent at the counter also told us, “you can call this number to try to get a voucher, but they will just deny you.” American Airlines is extremely unprofessional, and even their employees know it. If you can avoid flying American, I would reccomend. They could atleast be more graceful with their mistakes.  Fly at your own risk, plenty of folks not following masks rules but I was woken up to be told I needed to scoot my mask up half an inch, to cover more of my nose since it was already covered. The flight was delayed, making me miss my connecting flight, so I was put on standby. I\\'m fairly small, but it doesn\\'t stop me from getting ran into or elbowed in the aisle seat, I\\'ve noticed over my past few trips that stewards take more precautions around spatial awareness the closer to the front of the plane they get. Never gotten an apology. The gatewoman was very short with everyone and told us to go to customer service without indicating where it was to get a new ticket - customer service then told us no, we should go back to the gate. When we returned, she was going off on yet another person. We were told to wait until the next flight, only to arrive at the gate and have us not even be on the list! Another flight gone, and I missed my Aunt\\'s wake, though I\\'ve been in airports since 7am. As I sit in the airport now hoping to catch the last plane of the night, I\\'m looking to rent a car and just drive the rest of the trip. Based on the rules of this site, I can\\'t speak on lost or damaged baggage issues, or make comments about compensation or associated insurance claims. I\\'ll say if it can be blamed on weather, they don\\'t seem to need to cover overnight hotels, destroyed baggage, or any associated things really. Bright side, I\\'ve been around quite a few cities just because I\\'ve had to be put up overnight so many times. You\\'ll pay for more than the flight fare for choosing American Airlines, beware.   I’ve had several negative experiences with airlines losing my checked baggage. I make it a point to travel light because of this, just a carry on nothing else. I was group 7 to board so by the time I got there there was no overhead bin space and I had to check my carry on luggage. To me that’s unacceptable, there should be one spot per seat and if someone else that boarded before me took my allotted space then that person should check his excess luggage not me. The attendant couldn’t care about my frustration, she was dismissive and rude. I won’t fly American Airlines again if possible. Too many times, I am done.   Lady checking us in was rude. She made me check my bag because it wouldn’t fit, but didn’t let me get my medicine or wallet out of it. Also my bag totally would have fit it was the same one I had on the way to Knoxville. Very annoying. When I asked them please not to lose my bag she said “pack a smaller one next time”  I will never fly with AA anymore. Customer service was very poor. Disrespectful and rude ground staff. We were delayed for 5 hours from NY to Boston. No clear instructions on what to do next. We we’re just told to wait until further notice. Not even food or water were provided. Some passengers have been waiting overnight in the airport because their flights was either canceled or rebooked. Caused so much stress for us.   I do not recommend flying with American Airlines during the pandemic. Our flight was packed full - there were no seats left to put space between yourself and other travelers to reduce the spread of covid. Also, AA says they require everyone to wear a face covering but an entire family next to me frequently took their face coverings off during the 4 hour flight (they were not wearing it 90% of the time) and the flight attendants did not do anything.   I flew from Phoenix via Dallas very early morning (6AM). The flight from Phoenix got delayed due to mechanical issues. I missed my connection. They scheduled me an other flight, it was delayed multiple times then got canceled 5PM. Then they scheduled an other one and I was on standby list. I waited hours to catch it but they couldn’t take me since it was full. They scheduled me the next day flight via Charlotte (I refused this one because it was going to take me even more hours if not days again to get to my final destination). I had to stay overnight to catch next day flight. I missed all my emergencies and appointments. I missed funeral I was attending as well and nobody cares. No customer care person can even listen, they are so rude and unprofessional. This is the poorest and careless service I have seen in my entire life.   We were delayed for an hour to go to Jamaica. On our way back, we had booked the 11am leave time from Jamaica to arrive in Atlanta Georgia by 5:30 to have dinner with family. They deleted that trip. Delayed to 9pm. I called and asked if we can change anything, they said it would cost $200. We didn\\'t do that. On our travel day they left 75 minutes late. We were moved to a 9:52 arrival time. Since we missed our connection. Then it was delayed as well! Landing at 11 at night. As of now. Terrible customer service. We now need to pay $100 for an Uber. And they only gave us meal tickets. If you can\\'t get flights on time, why are you in business? We will never travel on American again!   Was travelling from LAX to MCO as part of a Multi city trip from the UK. I was travelling with my wife and we had 2 check in baggages between us. One weighed 27kg and the other was 19kg. That\\'s a total of 46kg which was our allowance (23kg each). It was fine from LHR to JFK and JFK to LAX. But when we were checking them in at LAX, the agent thought she knew better than anyone else. We were initially surprised by how she was talking to her own staff at the check in counters. rude is an understatement. She then told us that it is a maximum of 23kg in each bag. We had to open our bags again and move some stuff from one bag to the other. I wonder what Kacy or American Airlines achieved by making us move stuff between our own bags? The agent is a disgrace to the airline as she doesn\\'t know how to speak to her own colleagues let alone customers.   This has got to be the worst customer support I have ever dealt with in any airline. I have been on the phone for hours now trying to book a flight with a credit and they still can’t figure it out. They just want to push it off on someone else. I will not be flying American Airlines again after all this hassle.   I was traveling from Austin to Chennai, India and my itinerary was booked with Qatar airways. My domestic transfer from Austin to Chicago was with American who code share with Qatar Airways. The gentleman at front desk said I am only allowed one check in bag instead of 2 but Qatar website clearly states 2 bags are allowed for economy. The guy in the front desk was too rude. When I checked with Qatar people in Chicago they say that American Airlines always does this since they have small flights and they said I could try to get refund in Doha. This is horrible from American Airlines. It’s not about the money I had to pay but it is about the ethics of whole thing.   I was ridiculed by a sales rep for being over-charged for a flight that was their screw-up, requested to speak to a manager, and the agent told me \"they dont have that option.\" I filled out a request form. And the \"complaint manager\" finally picks up on the issue, then writes this lengthy email to me about how much she cares and would like things straightened out, yet was unable to do anything. I found a flight with reasonable layovers to some odd start/end points, and then immediately noticed it was operated by AA. Turns out, a friend was on the same second leg, so I just opted to do it.  I had a question about my boarding pass that was printed without a seat assignment. No one was at the counter in the airport until literal boarding time. Even the captain was standing there waiting! The employees and management hardly take mask-wearing seriously. Half are without, yet its programmed in the speaker to enforce it. The staff also has no problem directing you to wear one. My first flight, we were told how careful AA was being, enforcing social distancing, separating seats, and not flying at capacity. I\\'ll say they had me fooled. As soon as the next flight was crowded and overbooked, we were crammed on there like sardines. We were then instructed to board and de-plane following directions to enforce social Distancing. Nothing was ever said about it after that statement. The whole flight spring up, and tried to mass-exit, flailing around as usual. I\\'ve flown with multiple carriers my entire life. From budget Spirit to business class Emirates. This airline continues to disgust me and continues to allow to spread its arms wide open for the plethora of terrible reviews directed into its lap. It\\'s like they are proud to maintain the status of \"worst airline.\" Looks like I need to practice my social distancing from this operation altogether.   I wish I read the reviews before booking with this airline. Priority baggage check in took over an hour with only 6 people ahead of us. Connecting flight was cancelled while on previous flight, but was not told from anyone from the airline. Another passenger told us from an alert on his phone. American Airlines tried to push us to the following day even though there was two later flights the same day. Booked a same day flight, was delayed 3 different times and was shifted to 4 different gates. I had the alerts on my phone but was not receiving them until a few minutes prior to boarding at a different gate. Thank goodness every one was delayed after putting panic in us. After waiting over 7 hours being messed around, finally arrived at destination without baggage. It’s been over 24 hours and still no one knows where our belongings are. There was no apology or compassion from anyone in this airline. Never had such a bad experience with airlines before.   I will never fly with American ever again. They screwed me and my family over completely. We were notified not even 24 hours before we leave Mexico that me, my 12 year old brother and my aunt are on a different flight to Chicago 2 hours apart from my parents and cousin and they fly to Dallas. We verified before we left that we were all flying together. They didn’t have any other flights available. Thank you American Airlines for your bad customer service. Me and my family will never fly with you ever again.   American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown in. The staff is rude, there’s always a delay and they don’t even give passengers vouchers though it’s their fault. Do Not fly with American Airlines. It’s the worst of the worst.  Reno to Punta Cana. 2 weeks before our trip, American Airlines cancelled our flight to connector DFW from Reno (where I live). They booked us leaving from Sacramento (2.5 hour drive away) 14 hours before our original flight on Friday night. Being employed, this ended up falling at the beginning of my workday. Contacted phone support, waited 1.5 hours on hold to let them know we couldn\\'t leave in the middle of a workday and let them know Sacramento was 2.5 hours away. They scheduled us into Chicago through United for Saturday morning around 00:30. I rented a car for $125 + $60 in gas to make the flight. On the way back our flight was 2 hours ahead of time. We left for the airport only to find it was actually going to be on time. So we were 5 hours early. They additionally booked our connector with 40 min to make it through customs, baggage pickup, baggage recheck and across DFW. We missed the flight by less than a min, they had just shut the doors even though they verified we were on our way. The attendant told me, \"We have a choice to wait or not - we didn\\'t.\" We then went to customer service, who booked us a flight to LAX with a 9-hour layover to connect to Reno. They additionally put us in a hotel. Upon landing we found out the hotel was 36 miles away without a shuttle. When I asked for a different hotel voucher, the attendant found one next to the airport. We walked back to the shuttle line and I thought maybe I should check the hotel. Upon calling I found out they had been sending people away for 2 hours because they were full. I went back to the counter, who found another hotel with a vacancy. We slept for 4 hours in the room stinking of marijuana, woke up to take showers, bought some bathroom necessities and donned the clothes we\\'d been traveling in for the previous day. Thankfully our flight was on Alaskan, so there were no more troubles from then on. Note: I was a loyal AAvantage cardholder before this. I will find a way to spend all of my miles and then never use that card or fly on American again.   Stop offering flights that you later cancel it’s a bait and switch tactic. People are catching on to the airlines offering several flights to seen accommodating, but just because the flight is not full you say the fight is delayed to bump the flight to a later flight that was already scheduled, in order to save your company money. Just don’t offer the flight in the first place. People have caught on to your bait and switch and are using other airlines. When the rude attendants feed lies about the weather they need to check the radar of where the plane is supposedly coming from. Everyone could have drove home and got there faster. Start offering free rental cars instead of the lies and stop offering flights that you plan to cancel.   I have flown around the world (several times) this is return trip, the first and last time I will fly with American Airlines. For me out of 4 flights they have a 50% success rating in getting the airplane off the ground. They are clearly trying to squeeze every penny they get and make the customer suffer in response. Because they have cut staff they now don’t have a pilot available to take me home to see my little girl on Valentine’s Day (if you have a lil princess im sure you can understand) this is after flying out to my destination the plane not being able to take off due to mechanical failure and me missing some of the fire fighting course I flew out for. They don’t care. Fly with someone else.   Chicago to Phoenix. American Airlines is embarrassing. One minute before boarding was scheduled to start last night, one minute, the counter representatives announced a delay “due to a missing Captain.” I went to the counter to share that the reason for the delay offered was a joke, not true and not transparent. Both counter personnel acknowledged I was correct, the Captain was reassigned to another flight at the last minute. Then, 20 minutes later, the flight was cancelled. We were forced to stay overnight in a hotel. The next day the flight was scheduled for 9:00 AM, then delayed to noon and now it was pushed to 3:00 PM. This is a joke. Laughable. Embarrassing.   Where to begin? You would think I was doing them a favor by using their airline. Cabin staff were rude and aggressive. Since it was my birthday we splashed out for 1st class seats. We might as well have ridden in the cargo hold. Do not fly with this airline. You will be treated with contempt. You are better off walking to your destination.   I have only flown AA twice. Both times, nothing but horrible. This last time was the worse experience I have had ever traveling. Was flying out from Norfolk Airport traveling to Albuquerque. Flight was scheduled for 5:15pm, I received a text around 2:30ish that my flight from Norfolk to Dallas was cancelled. Waiting in line at the service desk, the AA worker (nicest worker and best encounter all day) told me to hop on this flight that was going to Charlotte then to get on one from there to Dallas. Was worried, I thought everything was good. We land in charlotte, I had about 20 min to get to the connecting and ended up being delayed 45min. I wasn’t worried because I had a 5hr layover in Dallas. Land in Dallas and I decided to sit at the bar for the 5hrs to have dinner and some drinks to waste time. We are supposed to board at 10:50pm to go to ABQ. Everyone is lined up at the gate ready to board and 3min before boarding. (Not even exaggerating. Literally 3 min before boarding) the flight gets cancelled. We’re waiting in line at the service desk. Everyone is going crazy. I finally get up to the desk, this was the last flight of the night. Next option was to stand on stand by for the 4 different flights that were all sold out to Albuquerque tomorrow. (This was the option for everyone on that full flight. You think stand by was going to happen for everyone? NO.) so I ask the worker to put me on standby or what my options were to get home sooner. He tells me the next flight he could get me an actual seat on would be for Monday. That is Two days stuck in Dallas. I have work on Monday, this was not an option for me. I asked him about cancelling my flight and what AA would cover if I have to just get a rental car and drive. He said “because of the circumstances, AA could refund you up to $200 for your rental alone.” I said “perfect. Cancel my flight now and I will book a rental for tomorrow morning.” I then asked him “what about a hotel, are you guys going to pay to put me in a hotel tonight?” He said “AA will be sending you a link for some hotel choices to book and be covered under them.” I received the link, they gave 3 hotel options. All of these hotels were sold out before even getting the link. I showed him and he said “pick a hotel and AA will reimburse you $125 for a hotel, just save all of your receipts and send everything in. I booked the hotel, he gave me vouchers for the taxi. Everything is fine. Next day, rental car cost me $444 ($200 of it being refunded at time of delivery) not including gas. I finally get home after driving 10 hours the next day. Submit all my receipts and the issue and AA responds a week later “we can only give you a refund for the amount that the connecting flight to your destination was.” $57 it was. Then I replied “no, this work told me everything would be reimbursed, $125 credit in hotel and my rental would be taken care of. All three of my flights that day had issues, I was stuck in Dallas, and you guys wanted to keep me there 2 extra days stranded” they respond “my apologies I can give you a check for $100 for the hotel. And $100 in flight credit only. The guy that told you about the rental was wrong.” American is the worst airlines, I have never had some many issues with an airline and now I’m out of $300 that will not be refunded because the crew members didn’t want to “show up”. Absolute joke! I will plan a one way trip with that airline just to get use of the credit and never fly AA again.   We were told that the flight was overbooked. They offer money for volunteers and finally they asked the last passenger to check-in their Baggage because they have no room. When I ask why, the lady without answering started screaming at me.   Asheville to Newark via Charlotte. Flights, personnel and seating was excellent this trip. Everyone was accommodating, especially Lynn in Charlotte. Allowing to store carryon suitcases in planes cargo hold was convenient and cost effective. For basic economy pricing.   I bought insurance on American. I had to cancel the flight and they didn’t refund me because my reason didn’t qualify. On another flight I wasn’t able to check in on phone. Got to airport 2 hours early and couldn’t check in at kiosk. Had to wait in main assistance line. By time I got to front was less than 40 minutes before flight and they said I couldn’t check in - re booked me for 6 hours later with no other options. Never flying American again. Go Southwest all day  The absolute worst. The crew is beyond rude, always late and they don’t pick up the trash from the flight before. Likely because they can’t make it on time ever.  Rome to Phoenix via New York. We were supposed to fly home from Rome on 7/27. We were at the check-in line 3 hrs before departure. The airport was busy but we were able to reach the agent 40mins before boarding time. The agent appeared to have trouble entering our data then called his supervisor. After about 20 mins, they said there was a problem with my name on their reservation system and could not issue me a ticket. They said the plane is leaving and cannot help me in time and for me to call their customer service number. As this was the first time this happened to me, I didn’t know better and didn’t argue. BIG MISTAKE. Rome is 6 hours ahead of US eastern time and we had to wait until their lines opened. I then spent a fortune in international phone calls holding on their line. At about 4pm Rome time, my wife and I decided to book another flight ourselves with Delta with money I didn’t have plus the next availability is not till 8/1 so we also had to shell out more $$$ for hotel. As of this writing, we are still stuck in Rome. I need to get home and take some time to relax before going on a crusade to get an apology and compensation for all the stress, fear and anxiety we have experienced.   I\\'m a disabled veteran and was told twice that I would receive a refund. They decided to give me a flight credit and will not refund my ticket even though I canceled within 24 hours. \\xa0 \\xa0This is the first time I had used American Airlines and I will not use them again. I landed in Dallas with an hour and a half layover. I checked my app to make sure no changes were made, saw the gate it said the plane would be. I went there and waited. While checking my app periodically to ensure no changes were made, I waited in the same spot for an almost an hour. When it was close to the departure time, (roughly 15 minutes) I went to an attending and asked about my flight to Idaho. He told me that the plane has just left. I asked him if it was announced over the PA system and he said yes. The gate I was at was E24b and the new gate the plane went to was E27. I didn\\'t hear anything over the PA system about any changes or that they were boarding for my flight. I am not a frequent flyer, so I asked what I needed to do. He directed me to the American Airlines customer service desk. There were 2 staff, each at a computer, and a person was in front of me. Both staff decided to help him at the same time. Tears welled up in my eyes, I was already trying not to cry, because I knew the information I had and knew that I wasn\\'t far away from the gate I thought I needed to be and the new gate and I felt like I had been highly mislead. Finally one of the staff calls me up to the counter asked me how she could help me, I tell her that I had missed my flight and in the middle of holding back tears and conversing with the staff, she completely ignored me and continued to have a conversation with the guy who was in front of me, cracking jokes and laughing as I waited patiently for her to bring her attention back to me. She then informed me that she could get me on the next flight (730pm) and as she typed in the information, she then told me that the flight was full and that I would be on standby. Again, not a frequent flyer, so I inquired what that meant. She explained and continued asking questions, which if I couldn\\'t get on this flight that I would have to spend the night and the next flight wouldn\\'t be until 7/27/24 at 7pm. I landed in Dallas at 930am 7/26/24. I got a boarding pass with standby. This was the most recent experience, but my first trip out to South Carolina, through American Airlines was also a hassle. The staff was very vague in their answers and very inattentive to me. From the other reviews I\\'ve seen, others seem to have similar experiences. Don\\'t fly American Airlines. If I could I would give the overall rating a 0.   The worst airline ever. I highly recommend NOT to book with them at all. They have the worst customer service. They lie and I can’t believe why they lie. There was a flight delay and I missed my connecting flight. I was told that my connecting flight will be held until I and other passengers arrive. We were later only for 15 minutes and our connecting flight was closed. When I called the customer service, they said no available flight and I had to wait 24 hours to get a new flight. That was not correct as I told them that I see other flights that leave earlier . They hanged up and it was so rude. They have no moral values at all. They deceive you.   The flights are always delayed. Save your time, money and effort and stay away from this airline. Do not book a flight with them if you have a connection or if you need to be at your destination on time! My flight from SFO to phoenix was delayed (just waiting on the airplane). And the next flight was closed early but the plane just laid there for a lot of time. They intentionally want you to lose your flight because then they say it’s due to air traffic and won’t give you any vouchers for food or hotel. Your spot is already taken by someone else because they oversell tickets. And then they book you to the earliest flight the next day. My next morning flight was the same story. We were waiting for over an hour inside the airplane and I was terribly nervous because to lose a very important appointment. I couldn’t recommend them less.  Horrible as usual. American Airlines has delayed the majority of our flights in the past 2 years and not just from weather. Many flights have been delayed due to maintenance issues. We have missed many connections and have been forced to stay overnight in other cities due to missed connections. American Airlines has cost us extra time and money more often than not. I wish we had more options from the closest cities we can fly out from. Truly a joke. It’s no wonder they rank at the bottom in recent years.   I will never fly American again! They missed my connecting flight on the way to Costa Rica and I spent seven hours in Miami airport. Now, I have been delayed and diverted on my return flight, so not only will I miss my connection again, I will have to find overnight accommodations and take an unpaid day off work tomorrow. Oh, and to make things better, all of the flights from Mimi to Newark tomorrow have layovers. Why should I expect them to be made?   My flight from Washington DC to Boston was delayed 7 hours! After I texted customer service I was mad and asked why the flight was delayed for 7 hours and 45 minutes. She told me goodbye without any reasonable response! Then I called and the lady on the phone was very unprofessional, she was saying yes your flight is delayed and this is not my mistake you can go to another company if you would like! and that said, the airplane still has some technical issues! I mean for 7 and 45 minutes delayed because the airplane was broken. This is not acceptable. I am done with American Airlines. this will be the last trip for me with American Airlines. Customer service is zero. Air services are zero.   American Airlines continues to disappoint, as does the Miami airport. Flight from Barbados arrived 100% on time, and was even acknowledged by the gate clerk who rebooked me on standby the next morning. Connection left a number of us stranded when the Miami airport was understaffed and got our luggage to us late for transfer, and couldn’t get us through the line in time. I’m sleeping in the airport tonight as AA is taking no responsibility for not holding the plane and leaving us all behind. I’ve been flying for 5 decades and this may be the most disgraceful and incompetent handling of a trip I’ve ever seen.   They started out delaying our flight at PLC. Then upon arrival to Philadelphia, they delayed our flight four times. I spoke to the customer service desk three times requesting a hotel room and was met with disdain. I was told that we\\'re unable to offer you anything until your flight is canceled. But it was never canceled. Only delayed until they could not offer anyone comfortable accommodations for the night. As time passed, I asked what is the reason for the delay and was told the crew has timed out. So, why would American Airlines and Oneworld Alliance book a flight full of passengers to have us stranded at the airport to sleep on a restaurant bench and/or chair. While the employees of American Airlines stated, \"We are leaving because we don\\'t get paid to stay over and another set of representatives will come to assist you.\" (The two reps left the desk with at least 20 ticketed customers standing in line at 2200 in concourse B of the Philadelphia Airport on Saturday, May 18, 2024.) Another representative showed up, but stated she was leaving at 2230. I called customer service around 0100 and was was sent a hotel voucher around 0020, but upon clicking the link it displayed \"No hotel rooms available at the moment.\" I rechecked for room availability around 0200, but the hotel stopped check-in at 12 midnight. Needless to say, we spent the night stranded in the airport due to American Airlines poor planning for ticketed customers. I sent a complaint to customer relations and requested a refund or at least something comparable to appease us due to the inconvenience and missed engagements the next day. I was only met with 2500 award points. Where can I possibly flight in the US with 2500 points, but no where other than the restaurant bench we got kicked off of or the chair that I spent the remainder of the night located at Gate B8. Giving me enough points for a flight or a travel voucher wouldn\\'t bankrupt you. Please review all the attachments of delays and a letter from customers relations.   Worst customer service ever, unpleasant employees and just paid to make customers day awful. Never flying with them and never recommending them. Add to this the usual delays.   Delayed 2.5 hours, and changed the gate 3 times, I spent more time in the airport tram, than I spent on the plane. Horrible experience.   Worst experience ever. Checked in 3 hours before, then attendant told me the flight has been delayed for two more hours. Had be reassigned to a different gate. Later they changed the flight to another hour with another gate change. By the end of the night I was placed on standby as well as a military family with 3 kids. They said the flight was fully booked and turned them and me away. I spoke to the general manager, and he seemed oblivious to the whole situation and was very rude. I had to check into a hotel out of my own expense. I got an email at 5 am saying I had be rescheduled a flight at 9 am. I checked in early, got on the plane and then had to exit the plane as the plane was having issues with the fuel and technical issues. Then reassigned another gate and plane. It was unreal, the customer service was terrible. Do not fly with American Airlines ever!   Last time I’ll ever fly American. Website must have glitched out or maybe I misclicked on my return flight. Didn’t notice until I was looking at my flight schedule, luckily I caught it you know, a week in advance. Decided to call thinking it would be no big deal, it’s not like I waited until I was at the airport to make a last second change. I was very wrong. The representative on the phone was very rude and wouldn’t let me change the flight without an additional fee despite my flight insurance. My wife’s experience wasn’t much better. She needed to change her flight due to her father dying and AA decided to harass her about it saying they won’t do it unless she can provide a death certificate which she didn’t have since it had happened so recently. There’s a time to use a little common sense and be somewhat compassionate but not for American Airlines. As long as they bleed you out of every last dollar they could care less.   Took this on a return flight from Miami to Austin. We had boarding group 5 plus I WAS an AAdvantage (cancelled my card as this was the last straw) when we arrived to the gate the attendant was on to group 6, she informed us we needed to go to the back of the line behind 8. I have flown this airline for many years (loyalist for 6 and was my preferred airline for all my work trips) according to the policy for your AAdvantage card we get preferred boarding. In the past the attendant would let me in if I the group had already boarded when I arrived. This time was different and seemed to be just her idea of what she wanted to do. To note I was polite as I get that airlines are short staffed and the team is spread thin however I am a paying customer and do not feel your staff are extending the same courtesy, in fact I felt embarrassed. To be abused by the staff when I spend my money is not my idea of money well spent and if I had friends that treated me this way I would not be their friend. I will be avoiding this airline at all costs going forward.   Did nothing to correct passengers wearing their mask under their noses or in some cases not at all during the flight. Multiple opportunities to correct passengers were seen and ignored. Given the most recent variant and staffing shortages with airlines I was really dissatisfied with the whole experience. I won’t use American Airlines again.  My first flight was delayed by 5 hours making me loose my connecting flight to my destination, once I arrived late and missed my original connecting flight they made me get a different destination and I still had to figure out a way to get to my destination making me get a bus for 5 hours to get home so my 8 hour flight turned out to be a 24 hour day flight and bus ride, I had to pay my transportation to get to my original destination, let along my baggage was delayed 4 days. One bag was lost, seems like the tag was removed so they had to open up my bag to see if I had personal information so they could get a hold of me and once my bag was brought to me half my stuff was missing once it finally arrived. Extremely upset with my flights, one being delayed 5 hours the other flight changed to a whole different destination and half my stuff missing. I had to insist every day to get my bags brought to me and would call 3 times a day to know when my baggage was going to get to me and they would say there is no space for my bags, you would think they would make space for it and it would be priority but no I had to insist non stop to finally get my bags. So yes bad service.  This airline is undeniable garbage. It’s sad because it’s clear that all of the issues come from money grabbing, corner-cutting greed of like the C-suite that has now led to an absolute disaster for customers. I found this website to rip them to shreds because it’s impossible to even leave feedback for them. They don’t allow a written documentation sent about topics they deem unworthy via their bizarre labyrinth of a website. My baggage was delayed from my flight from nyc to Panama City beach, Florida with a layover in Charlotte. The big tech shortage happened, so I didn’t want to place to much blame initially, so I filled out the form and tried to wait patiently. But now it’s the next day and there has been no confirmation of my baggage arriving or in route. In fact after tracking my bag, not through the delayed baggage system, I saw that it was sent to Dallas, Texas. Also I’ve been on hold for now 36 minutes after being on hold yesterday for an outrageous amount of time. They clearly lean heavily on automated messages and communication systems. There needs to be accountability! I’m fuming because I never check bags but had items for my sister’s bachelorette goodie bags that couldn’t go as carry-on. I hope American Airline has an internal reckoning and gets their act together. It’s unprofessional, disrespectful and inappropriate. I won’t be flying with them again if I can avoid it.  Used AA twice in March. Once from YYZ to MIA on March 2nd with AA 1572 and return flight on March 13th from MIA to YYZ with AA 1572. After reading numerous bad reviews I do feel obliged to write my review even though the flights were done a few weeks ago. Check in were both time swift and friendly, boarding was highly civilised, flights left and arrived on time, planes were clean, service was attentive and friendly. Travelled with dog in cabin and all rules were explained and followed in a non threatening and pleasant way. There were absolutely no complaints from my side whatsoever. Even the ticket price was highly competitive. I see no reason not to give 10 points and thumbs up.  I purchased a flight for my mom to come to Louisville for a visit but her flight was delayed multiple times then canceled, I was able to get her rebooked for the very next morning but that flight was canceled as well and now the airline is trying to book her on another day altogether which won’t work because we were taking her to Gatlinburg for her first time there and changing her flight to a completely day that would prevent us from doing so. They wouldn’t even change her flight to an airline close to Gatlinburg and they refuse to give me a refund. I don’t know how they can treat people like this and get away with it.   Some of the cabin crew were extremely rude. I was forced to fly American Airlines via British Airways and I would never want to wish this on my worst enemy. Please stay away at all costs.   Boarding agent was a rude POS.  I tried to tell her 3 times I had an upgrade boarding pass even when I was the very last person at the gate! 3 times! Even while I am telling her again she is telling me to board, even while the scanner is rejecting my original boarding pass and she has my upgraded military seat in her hand. Still harassing me. I didn\\'t ask for the upgrade, it was given to me at previous airport.   They delayed us in Austin for over an hour for no reason, and then after running to the the gate with a baby, we caught the gate open, and they closed the door on us. We arrived at the gate at 435 and the flight departed at 445. They are so rude at customer service, because more than 11 of us lost our flight due to their delay and they didn’t even hold the door.  All 4 flights were delayed significantly with no explanation, no food or drink or bathroom while trapped in plane sitting on runway for over an hour, staff was very rude on all flights, passengers were clumped together in one section of the plane even though the rest of the plane was empty. No amenities, no customer service.  American Airlines has lost any sense of urgency. Shrouded in the incompetent cloak of blame TSA, blame air traffic control, blame the ramp team. The bottom line is you are late —- you miss your flight and the couldn’t give a flip less. Thanks Boston team on AA0415. You ruined my trip, my evening and my work day because you couldn’t hold AA1494 just eight minutes. Especially when you do it when it suits you. New rule. I will drive anything 10 hours. 10 flipping hours rather than deal with your self entitled drama.   I am flying with American Airlines  today. I have had hands down the worst experience of my life. The employees are untrained, lack manners and basic knowledge required to preform their job duties. I ask to be placed on stand by for a flight before my current scheduled. I was sent back and forth between 7 different people and no one able to help me. I cannot be placed on stand by from the app, web, ticket counter, agent counter, reservation line or customer service line. So how do you expect customers to utilize stand by to ease travel? There is absolutely no way to get help or guidance. My already stressful day was made 100x worse by American Airlines useless employees. I expect more from American Airlines. I have no intention of flying with you again and will plan on sending my family, friends and clients to a different an airline with employees that are helpful and competent. American Airlines is a disgrace to the travel industry.   American Airlines gets worse and worse each time I fly with them.. I’ll never book another flight with this company! The staff are rude and there is clearly an internal situation happening with all the delays and cancelled flights! \\xa0 \\xa0Flight from St Thomas to Philly was delayed causing us to miss connecting flight from Philadelphia to Boston. Once on plane in Philadelphia it was determined we didn’t have enough fuel so headed back to get fuel. Now we have missed our shuttle to the airport which will certainly cost us stupid money because the shuttle is no longer running. We still have a three hour drive to maine. Haven’t eaten since 2:00 in St Thomas as and it is 11:46 pm. And we haven’t left Philly yet. Now we may not even fly because of wind situation. Worst flying experience yet. Unbelievable  Austin to Boston. They are very rude and insensibly annoying. They made me to check-in my carryon at the gate because they said there is no space in the plane. When I got to the plane there were plenty of space that I could use for my carry-on. So they lie too. Also when you check-in your carryon at the gate instead giving you the carryon at the arrival gate they send it to luggage claim so basically your carry-on is destroyed and ruined. I hate this airline   I checked in early on my way to the airport, went to the Kiosk to print boarding pass gave me error and instructed me to see an agent. While on my line the American airline staff continuously breaking the line and allowing passenger of her choice before me, upon asking she told me that I already missed my flight which proved to be a lie as once i got a chance to the agent finally I got my boarding pass and got on board but literally in last minutes. I was stressed because that staff lied and didn\\'t do the job the right way. There should be proper check and balance for such a misconduct.   Just before leaving for airport, I got a text that my flight is cancelled and that is being rebooked. I rushed to the airport only to find out that there\\'s no alternative way I can reach my destination on the same day. American airlines wasted a very important day in my tight schedule that cannot be put into tangible value. This doesn\\'t end here, the aa agent guy rebooked for the next day and I thought the worse part is over. I\\'m 6.1\" and I always book the seats with extra legroom. It\\'s expensive but on long flights it\\'s the only way I can humanly travel on aa flights. During rebooking, this wasn\\'t taken into account and I was given a regular seat right in the middle. 15 hours of torture after paying extra for a better seat!   I hate flying on AA with a passion unknown to mankind. The reason I chose to fly from to MIA on AA recently is that it was non-stop-if either the really, really nice folks at SWA or even the marginally nice folks at Delta or UA had a non-stop on this route, I would have flown with them at up to double the fare-seriously-that is now much I hate flying on AA. I have NEVER had even an above average flight with AA & have been flying domestically & internationally since I was 20 & have no idea how many times I have flown with AA during that time but it has been at least a dozen or two times or more. That may seem hard to believe but it is 100% true.  Mostly recently, an AA counter agent at MIA misinterpreted what I said to another passenger in line. This happened a day after I missed my international flight due to their errors and they would not let me on the flight even though the flight had been delayed but they wouldn\\'t reopen the door. They treated me like a child and made me wait until the end of boarding after another alleged agent manager admonished me for something I didn\\'t have clarity on what I did. Then, after I arrived at my destination, I learned that their staff, based on hearsay, said I made some sort of vague \"threat\" I did not make to anyone (I was talking to someone on my phone so naturally they could not hear the other side of the conversation) and I was detained at immigration at my international arrival location and illegally held beyond 48 hours in a jail cell with no ability to contact the US consulate or attorney before I learned that AA had lied - they stated it was not their decision to then have me deported, but they started the process based on false info. I mean if there was really an issue, why did they allow me to get on the flight to begin with? Naturally, AA tells you nothing. It then took me over a week, a lot of stress, and a lot of money to the right connections to get back into the country of my final destination. I have suffered both mental and physical fallout from this situation, a complete overreaction by the terrible AA staff that had no basis in any reality or danger whatsoever. Of course when one reaches out to \"contact us\" at AA for weeks you get auto-generated e-mails then naturally, nothing-no response at all. This is after AA tried to ruin my life after I had just retired.   We flew from SLC to DFW and then had a connecting flight from DFW (Dallas) to DTW (Detroit). We got a notification like 6 hours before our first flight that it was delayed 30 minutes. We got to our gate and then it got delayed another 15 minutes. This delay caused us (and many others) to miss our connecting flight. American Airlines has the worst scheduling ever. They do not take into account that it takes 10 minutes from landing to taxi to your gate and then another 15 minutes to deplane. Then our next flight was scheduled across the entire airport of Dallas. It took almost 20 minutes to get from the gate we landed at to our next gate. Even if our first flight wasn\\'t delayed we wouldn\\'t have made it to our next flight. Horrible planning by American Airlines. I\\'ve never had any problems when I fly with other airlines, especially Delta. I have only had problems when I fly with American. They knew I wouldn\\'t make my next flight before our first flight even took off. They just scam you for your money. You pay them for a service that isn\\'t provided most of the time and then make it your problem to figure out what to do because they don\\'t care about their customers. Also, on our first flight the AC was broken so it was 90 degrees on a 3.5 hour flight. Horrible experience. I will never fly with this company again. At least they give you biskoff cookies I guess.   Worst customer service I can remember in a long time. We planned a trip with our kids for my wife\\'s birthday flying out at 7:00 am. A month after paying a significant amount for these tickets I get an email informing me our departure time was moved to 5:11 am and our return flight that was set for afternoon was moved to 10:00 eliminating any time to enjoy the last day with no discount to our price. We did our best to make it work and at the check in kiosk it didn\\'t allow an option to check back .. apparently we missed the 45 minute limit by a minute. The rude attendant by the time we got her attention said there was nothing she could do we needed to hope we could rebook a later flight. Later we found out this was not true and the attendants at the desk could have checked our luggage up to 30 minutes before which she did not tell us. I ran up to the airport store bought a carry on bag, through what we could in, ran suitcase back to car, and ran to gate as fast as you can with a 6 and 8 year old. As we got there they told us we could not board and the plane was gone .. although it could be clearly seen outside the window. On top of that was the continued most unfriendly customer service experience i\\'ve been through in years......couldn\\'t care less and you were lucky they would acknowledge you. Luckily they found us another flight ... 12 hours later and charged us an additional $300 to save those seats. If you can avoid this airline at all costs, there are others that actually pretend like they care and aren\\'t just there to rudely screw you out of every dollar they can.   Absolutely the worst experience we\\'ve ever had. This company cost me hundreds of dollars and not a single employee cares about the issues they\\'ve caused you. First our flight was delayed, then they cancelled it, then they \"gave us a hotel\" which we had to pay $60 for an uber to get there in the middle of the night. Then we weren\\'t able to get on a shuttle and paid another $40 for an uber trip back to the airport. THEN they lost our luggage. Seriously, pick another airline!  Pay for first class ticket, delay after delay. Go to the rest room, they board and close the gate ahead of what was said, they left several people standing there clueless for us to go figure it out. I hate this airline, will never fly with them again.   A horrible experience and even worse customer relations after the fact. My most recent flight with American Airlines was delayed by 17 hours and customer relations refuses to give me a refund. I was/am pregnant and was traveling with my 18 month old son. Our layover between flights was supposed to be only 1 hour and turned into a stressful, exhausting 17 hour delay. We waited until 1 am at our gate when we were told to change terminals entirely to go to different gate. After waiting an hour more at this new gate, American Airlines canceled the flight entirely for that night. We were given an $11 meal voucher and told to “book our own hotels” and American would reimburse us. Finally at 4 in the morning I was able to get my 18 month old son to sleep at a hotel we had to book and get an Uber to with no help from American. We only were able to stay for 4 hours before heading back to the airport. When we got back our flight was delayed again. We boarded a plane, we’re told to get off and change planes and wait. It was so tiring and during this time no more meal vouchers were offered so I was paying for everything out of pocket. I missed two days of work because of this fiasco. Since this trip from hell, I have been contacting American Airlines and offered no refunds or compensation. The only thing I was given was a $25 credit for my next flight. No I am not kidding. $25! Not even a refund for the hotel they promised to pay for! I quite literally lost over a thousand dollars because of this flight and I do not have that kind of money. Absolutely the worst experience ever. I am so disappointed in American Airlines and would recommend that people fly with literally ANY other airline.   Boarded plane at Colorado Springs, Colorado and pulled onto the tarmac only to pull back into the airport due to mechanical problems and weather at layover destination in Dallas/Ft Worth. After a 6 hour delay, finally got into the air. Upon landing, my connecting flight had already departed. AA placed me onto another connecting flight after another 16 hour delay. Employee told me to just \"grab a chair and take a nap\". Are you kidding me! Instead of trying to accommodate me by trying to get me onto an earlier flight I was left to sit in the terminal without any apologies or accommodating me with a hotel or eats. I will never choose this airline again and definitely will use its competitors from this point on. Very dissatisfied with the lack of empathy this airline has for its customer base.   Don\\'t fly with America Airlines. Ordered tickets with their agent on phone to make sure that my parents (81 with Parkinson\\'s and 85 with cancer) would have seats that could lay down for the 10 hour flight. My husband and I in main cabin. Because my parents don\\'t know how to you the internet and check in online. My mom with Parkinson\\'s was bumped back. My father took her seat, so he got no rest. My mom needed someone to help her and no one was there.  Customer service is well that is our policy. Sorry you had a bad trip. No ticket with AA guarantees your seat. They can change or kick you off at any time.   Phoenix to Guadalajara. For over 10 years I used to travel with Alaska Airlines, but because they didn’t have direct flights to Guadalajara I decided to try American Airlines which I regret. For two people we just had one suitcase and we paid $30 dollars, but not just that, after they provided me the weight which was 56 lbs they said it was going to be $100 dollars more which is ridiculous, two people one suitcase that was it. I didn’t bring with us smaller suitcases for carry on inside the flight because I didn’t have, so I thought maybe will be better just one for both of us. I had to take the 6 lbs out of the suitcase. Their staff rude and mean, except one lady who helped me to check us in .   I recommend taking another airline. If you have the option this is the worst airline I’ve taken. My flight home was supposed to be four hours and ended up turning into a nightmare and lasting me 24 hours to get home. My flight kept delaying and was eventually canceled calling customer service was a mess as they were rude and not helpful at all. Plus I’ve never had any issues flying till I’ve taken American Airlines which is my first and last time, I never write reviews but I wanted to make sure people do not go through the same thing as I went through. Traveling alone is supposed to be smooth, but ended up traumatizing me. I definitely won’t be flying with American Airlines again.   So just booked over $4,000 worth of tickets for January 2022 and then they show I have to call American Airlines to get a seat assignment for my group of 4. So I call them. They tell me it will be a 2-3 hour wait. OK, fine. They say they will call me back and I won\\'t lose my place in line, so I choose that option. Then they tell me I can choose to have someone call me tomorrow or the next day, up to a week from today. But nothing for today. So I go back to stay on hold for 2-3 hours. No problem, I understand they are busy and want to hire only one person to handle all of their customers. Now comes the crazy part, every 12 seconds: 1. Vouchers expiring between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 may be extended for 1 year by contacting customer relations on AA.com. 2. Vouchers expiring between January 1, 2021 and May 31, 2021 are automatically extended to expire on March 31, 2022 And this goes on and on.  Instead of helping, they seem to enjoy hurting people. This is a horrid way to take care of your customers.   We had an amazing flight there and back for our honeymoon in Aruba. Our flight attendant Krishana was such an amazing person, that made us feel so special and welcomed on the flight. She deserves an award, because she is patient about making the customers feel good and comfortable during their flights.   To begin, I booked our flight to Tampa from Phoenix in January. Paid extra to have a direct flight home from Tampa to Phoenix. In February American took it upon themselves to not only delay our flight to Tampa but also add a layover in Dallas on the way home. Now I was obviously annoyed but chose not to complain at that time as it wasn’t a huge deal. Well cut to the layover as we are waiting to get on our flight home the weather in Dallas is beginning to rain and our flight gets delayed 3 times then cancelled entirely. We rebook one immediately for 3 hours later than our original flight, then that flight gets delayed 3 more times. All while tons of flights at the airport are being cancelled and the bad weather is scheduled for another 6 hours I expected that our rebooked flight would likely be cancelled as well and the customer service line already had at least over 300 people in it so we got in line to speak to someone regarding what the next step was if this flight got cancelled as well since that one was at 11pm and I didn’t plan to sleep at the airport. Meanwhile the airport employees are referring us to call the customer service line so I called them while we waited in line. Spoke to a staff member who was very polite and understanding but didn’t have a resolution for me so I held for over 2 hours to speak to her supervisor. After hours in the line we made it to the front and the lady was less than helpful and completely rude. Her resolution was that she could cancel the flight we had re-booked and rebook us at the earliest 9pm the following day with no accommodations because it was “weather related”. I again explained that we were not supposed to have this layover to begin with. Her resolution to that rather than admitting that that is poor customer service on Americans part was that I should have complained when it was changed. So me being nice and letting that slide was now my fault so you’re encouraging that I complain in advance next time? She then said I was being disrespectful and asked me what I wanted from her. I simply explained that I wanted accommodations if the rebooked flight was cancelled. She told me I would have to get back in line (the line that now has well over 800 people in it) when that flight was cancelled. I asked her to just place a note in my file that we had waited 3 hours in the line already and that we were requesting a hotel accommodation if the flight was cancelled. She said a note isn’t going to do anything everyone else is waiting too and slid me back my ticket and called up the next customer. The other party that was with us was asking the other attendant for the same thing and the lady got extremely hostile and defensive and said “Are you trying to fight me?” None of us were being hostile towards them so for an employee to speak to a customer in that manner is completely unprofessional. Cut to after we left the counter with no resolution I finally got a supervisor on the line and she was very polite and willing to hear me out but unable to help me either. Then we finally get on the rebooked flight, just thankful that it wasn’t cancelled at this point then get on the tarmac and have to sit there for over an hour behind 15 other planes and then they lost our luggage to top it off which also happened at the DFW airport the last time we had a lay over there too. So disorganized, insulting and distasteful customer service.   Utterly appalling incompetence. I was scheduled to fly CAE-DCA-PVD on Aug 11. They canceled the flight. I rescheduled the same route Aug 12. They delayed the CAE flight from 6:30 am to 9:30 to 10:00 to 12:00. I believe it actually left CAE at 2:00. But I wasn\\'t on it because I couldn\\'t get rescheduled through to PVD. So they moved to to a CAE-CLT-PVD flight that was scheduled to leave at 11:30. At 1:20 we were still sitting in the airport. I went to speak to one of the agents because I knew I wasn\\'t going to make the connection in CLT. I stood in front of her for 20 minutes while she blatantly ignored me. No acknowledgement whatsoever. And then I gave up. I had been trying to make this trip for 30 hours to celebrate a friend\\'s retirement. I paid for the tickets that they clearly did not schedule adequate aircraft and crews for, I took vacation time from my job. And for what? To sit in an airport for hours  and not get anywhere. Really wish I could give a 0 rating.   Horrible airline, forced to fly one AA twice a week for work. Since January. Every flight I\\'ve taken with them has been delayed 45mins to 3 hrs. I only get Saturday and half of Sunday off before I fly out again in the early hours of Monday morning. Highly annoyed that most of my Friday gets taken as well due to sitting in the airport waiting for AA to get their act together. Not to mention they damaged my bag after a flight which was a 3hr delay on that flight putting me back in Atlanta at midnight. I would have filed a claim if I felt like wasting yet another hour at the airport dealing with American airlines.   It’s really sad to be prejudged. I get complimentary upgrades because I fly quite frequently with American Airlines. I’m standing in the priority lane and an American airline staff member told me I needed to get out of the line and go where they are scanning in the bags, this is for first class. I told her I was first class. She should’ve checked the people in front of me, who actually didn’t belong in the line. But I’m going to assume it’s because I’m black and they were white.   By far the worst experience I\\'ve ever had with an airline. 7 hours of flying turned to 40 hours when they delayed my flight so I didnt catch a connection. Their solution was booking a new flight 24 hours later that has an additional stop. No hotel voucher and no food vouchers. The employees are extremely rude and unhelpful. I will never use this airline again and I seriously suggest you avoid them. Even if they\\'re cheaper or the flight is shorter it wont work out how you think. I cant say enough bad things about them.   Worst travel experience I have ever had. I left for a work trip on Monday 09/12 from Boston and was supposed to land at Hilton Head Island at 5:30PM but the flight from Boston was delayed from landing which caused me to miss my flight from Charlotte NC to HHH (which was also last flight of the day). I had to be put on a flight to Savannah GA (which was delayed for an hour from taking off) then drive an hour to get to my hotel. I didn’t get to my hotel until 9:30 PM! A 4 hour difference! On the way home, flight from HHH to Washington DC was fine until we landed at 2PM and we weren’t able to exit the plane for an hour which caused me to miss my flight to Boston which left at 3PM. I was transferred to a 5PM flight which was also delayed until 5:42PM but didn’t even take off until 6:12PM. I was supposed to land in Boston at 4:30PM but didn’t actually land until 8PM! A 3.5 hour difference. I will never fly with AA again. It was my first and last time. Literally the worst travel experience I ever had.   This is the fourth time I have flown with American Airlines. Each time it is something different. Either the plane needs maintenance or they don’t have the pilots at the terminal yet, or they have to recalculate the route and get more fuel. It’s very frustrating as a repeat customer to never reach my destination in time. I have meeting that I have to reschedule or family has to wait for hours at the airport waiting for me to land. American Airlines you should be ashamed and pay me back for the inconvenience you have caused for the last four of my trips   American Airlines is responsible for the worst travel experience I’ve ever had. My family including a 9 and 6 yr old plus grandma planned a flight out of Detroit, MI to Durango, CO with a layover in Dallas, TX. Our initial flight was delayed due to “maintenance and paperwork”. This caused us to miss our connecting flight. Although inconvenient, that in itself wasn’t the issue. These things happen. What follows is the problem. We were given no instructions on what to do next. There was no one at the gate…or any other AA gate. We dragged the family across the airport to where our missed flight gate was. No one there. After 45 min, we found a gate with an AA worker. After searching for another flight, we were told the only option is the following day at 10pm (it’s 9am at this point). Not satisfied we asked if there was anything else we could do. She was short with us, rude, and unwilling to help any further. She handed us a post card with a customer service number. We learned from a different airport employee that there was a customer service desk in the other side of the airport. We dragged the family over there. There was a 1.5 hour wait. In the meantime, we were on the phone with customer service (who showed effort in helping). With the help of the phone service, the desk attendant tried to piece together options to a different airport 100 miles from our destination. This required us to change rental car plans. But the desk attendant said that I would have to figure that out and go to the back of the line again. And her shift was almost done, so she said we would have to start all over again and there would be no guarantee that flight is available. Between my wife and I using 3 phones, we had to figure it out on our own over the next couple hours which resulted in a flight later in the afternoon to an airport 100 miles from our destination which took a 2.5 hour drive. But before we even got on that flight, we were told the gate attendant would help us get our kids seats switched so they didn’t have to sit alone (age 6 and 9). This attendant was less helpful and more rude than any of the previous ones. He just said we would have to figure it out on the plane. Towards the end of our now shortened vacation, we tried to check in early for our returning flight only to be told that it no longer exists. During that earlier process, they completely cancelled our flight. The seats were no longer available. So we had to spend 5 hours on the last day of our vacation scrambling to find a way home. We have since contacted American Airlines about this experience. All they offered us was $100 total credit. Completely unacceptable considering what we paid for 5 tickets and the experience we had. I have spoken to many others with similar experiences. I will NEVER use American Airlines again. I recommend no one does.   Rude people. Flight delayed 8 plus hours. Inability to get airplane to boarding dock once landed. Angry because I handedness slept in a day and a half trying to get a couple hundred miles. Terrible airline. Plus the wifi freezes up.   The most miserable air crew I have came across. I understand that work can be tiring, most of us have jobs, however we should all work towards better customer service. I got one smile off the host during the service, (not the usual host that came through the rest of the 9hr flight). The biggest smile I received was when we exited the plane. I would avoid AA in the future (running back to Singapore air). They insisted I check in my hand luggage due to a full flight. I have had this case for 10years with no issues, 1 hr being handled by AA (Dallas to Houston).  For a short flight that’s around 2 hours. I’ve never would had thought the service of AA was pretty much the same as flight with Spirit. If I knew of the service I’ll be getting today. I could had booked with Spirit and saved $400 in the different of price that you would receive from Spirit. This airline service has gone down since Covid for sure. I’m pretty disappointed with this flight and service today.  I fly AA at least 1x/month on full fare first class tickets between DFW and San Diego and, despite their premium fares which range between $1,200 to $2,200 for round trip first class tickets between the two cities, their service delivery is among the worst: chronically delayed, terrible attitude from reservations to flight crew and one lane excuse after another. Today, the flight was delayed (not weather related and no reason provided whatsoever) and flight attendant told me no food or drinks available by the time she got to my seat (1F). How could that be for a $1,200 ticket? That’s just this trip. Always an issue. The management of this airline appears to be among the most incompetent in the industry.   This is the worst airline I\\'ve ever flown on. Ground staff at JFK has attitude issue. Not helpful at all. \"Computer says No\" is probably their company motto. I\\'m a OneWorld emerald member, I wasn\\'t offered the lounge access, instead of giving us the help that we supposed to have, computer says no there is nothing we can do. You are welcome to purchase the pass if you want So I called Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong, they said we are surely entitled to the lounge access. On flight service is as appalling. I\\'m not going to spend my energy to drill down the details. This is the first time and also the last time I will travel on American Airlines. No more.   Well the plane was late (approximately 45mins) to Cabo as we are boarding the flight you get the privilege to witness some fine engineering at work as they are literally duck taping the plane. The only drinks were Coke Zero or Diet Sprite. Then we get to Dallas for our connecting flight to New Orleans the fact that Customs had only 3 agents trying to work some 300 people didn’t help, but we got through customs and security to run thru this airport and arrive at 7:03! That’s a whole 10 mins before the flight was supposed to leave but 5 minutes late to board, not only that the ticket agent saw us running her way at gate A18 and instead of talking with us she ran away so we had to go to another American Airlines gate to talk with someone on who only said we had to go to gate A20 who then said we had to go across the way to the customer service line that has a line down the hall and only 2 people working around 7:40 someone showed up saying we can call a 1-800 number now I’m stuck in this airport. Everything dealing with this airline today has been a nightmare!   So our flight from DIA was delayed by 30 minutes to Dallas Fort Worth. We where supposed to get a connection at 10:43 pm but since our flight was delayed we missed that connecting flight which was the last flight out of Dallas Fort Worth. So guess what we had to stay all night long until the next day/morning. The service rep said because our delay was due to weather we basically get nothing! Just stuck all night and we had a graduation to go too that day, it really put us behind schedule and I will never fly with this airline again! Our jumper flight was cancelled so we just rented a car and drove. We then received a notification saying that our flight had been rescheduled. We didn’t make that jumper flight, because we had already drove. A couple hours later we received another notification saying that all of our flights were cancelled because we missed that one in which we tried to cancel online but it didn’t work. We then got to the airport at midnight and waited around until 3 am, we got on standby and were told that we were “guaranteed” a spot on the plane. Our gate changed and we had to rush to it, we didn’t check in for stand by and we were never told we had to when speaking to the man at the front desk. So we got there and we are now stuck in Texas for another day. There has terrible communication and customer service. The amount of times they have messed things up is getting ridiculous. I am never flying with American Airlines.   This is a horrible experience! The initial flight is at 5:25am, they didn’t allow me to check my bag 40 minutes period to that and change my flights. Then I had to wait 12 hours at the Philadelphia airport just to know at last minute that the flight got cancelled due to weather, they said. The next confirmed flight is around 7:30 pm on the next day and they won’t pay for hotel or any compensation. I also have to go through many different people and processes. Just so horrible!   I was scheduled to fly from ORD to Reagan National. In March Washington DC was declared a state of emergency. The conference I was supposed to attend cancelled. I cancelled my flight. Subsequently, I contacted American Airlines, spoke to a live agent and supervisor who indicated that because the outbound flight did NOT leave and was later cancelled, I was entitled to a full refund for the round trip ticket - which she processed over the phone. I later received an email from American that my refund was being denied and they would only provide me a credit going forward. I contacted AA. Customer Relations who disregarded what their agent said and said no refund. I am super frustrated with American and it’s insensitive policies and customer service during this pandemic. I have been a loyal customer for over 30 years - but I am ready to make a change! Delta has no problem issuing customer refunds!   American Airlines changed the aircraft at last minute. I get that and understand that things happen. That said, they bumped me from 1st class, shoved a voucher in my face and rudely cattle-called me on my way without any representative taking a minute to answering questions I had about another flight. It seamed as though they were going out of their way to treat me as a non-person, just another schmuck that was unlucky enough to entrust American with his travel needs. I am finished with American Airlines.   Delayed in Honolulu due to a fuel issue. Waited in the gate for nearly 3 hrs before we were instructed to deplane and, because they changed gates from the original contingency plan, we had a marathon of a walk to the new gate. During the entire wait was never offered any water or snacks only litany of apologies. Due to the delays, none of the direct Phoenix to Washington DC/National flights were available for rebooking so I have to go through Charlotte. Arrived at Phoenix only to be greeted with another delay and gate change. At this point, not sure I\\'ll make my meetings the next morning. It also appears that giving people any kind of compensation is no longer a practice. Terrible service, poor customer service and bad business practices appear to be their corporate ethos.   I checked in on my phone, just as instructed, drove all the way to airport and because they didn\\'t receive my check in, they refused to allow me to take my original flight and forced me to take a later flight. After I went through the process of getting to the terminal, the original flight that I was supposed to be on, was literally still waiting to board for over 30 minutes, they were paid for my seat, so there is no excuse. I will never fly with American Airlines again, very unprofessional and very rude, if I could rate 0, I would.   Really nice flight except for Americans cost cutting. The Covid excuse is old Nice flight attendants who handled the occasional mask complainer well. Decent meals again Covid new standard. Great IFE great selection. Best AA experience in a long while.   Worst trip ever. Flight going was delayed so I missed my connecting flight and ended up at there airport for 9 hrs. Flight back was canceled and rescheduled. I missed my connecting flight again for another excuse. It\\'s been excuse after excuse as to all the delays and cancelled flights. I will never fly American Airlines again. It has been the worst travel experience I have ever had.   San Francisco to Los Angeles. I was made to check in my hand luggage for no apparent reason in a rude and unprofessional manner! Their planes are old and the service below zero. Never fly with them.   During a stopover, after having delayed by 1:30, make us sit in the plane 2 hours without a pilot and then they cancel the flight! It\\'s 11 p.m. (we were supposed to be at our destination at 10:20 p.m.) they send us to a far Hotel, in the city, by taxi, don\\'t pay us for any meal at night (I\\'m pregnant), to sleep for 2 hours because they put us back on a flight at 5:49am. No taxi found to bring us back at the airport at 3:00am. The new booking is a flight with a stopover to replace the only flight we had left to do; we will be home more than 12 hours later, hungry and tired!   My flight was cancelled because their de-icing machine was broken. Two days later the flight was again cancelled because they only have one deicing machine. This is a northern city, it is unbelievable they only have a single deicing machine and they cannot fix it in two days.   This is customer relations baggage and flight cancellation complaints in one. Never have I have seen such horrid communication and customer service in regards to a 2.5 hour delayed flight, then diverted, then ensuing madness of wanting and ability to get bags. Flight got into Orlando, was supposed to be Tampa, at 8:05. Sat and waited with little to no communication and when there was it was incorrect aggressive and defensive. Left hundreds stranded at Orlando international with no information other than the flight rescheduled for tomorrow. No info on baggage claim other than wait in hundred person line and ask for bag. Your airline has shown ineptitude in scheduling (no cockpit crew originally in Miami and foresight to know crew would bust time in Orlando while we waited) communication, and overall care of people. I hope people stop flying so you can then lose the money you should be spending to your employees to fully staff and adequately compensate so they\\'re not overworked and undertrained   Horrible experience trying to fly home internationally. AA overbooked by 9 seats, so only 2 of my 4 seats were available. They split my family up & sent my children on another plane without me. Customer service was awful & no communication about this issue. I had to keep inquiring as the employees carried on & laughed while my children boarded a plane without me. In addition, they had no issues charging me for luggage even though they gave my confirmed seat away. Apparently this airline is known for doing this so fly with someone else!!   Both of our planes to Dallas and from Dallas had an hour long delay! Our morning flight from Cancun at 7 got delayed. How is the first flights of the morning encountering long delays? American Airlines sucks and needs to get more airplanes if all of them are going to need maintenance everyday. Tired of waiting for hours at the airport and missing our connecting flights all because American Airlines is unprepared!   Staffing shortage, I wish someone had warned me, American is canceling flights to smaller airports. I ended up flying in to Philadelphia, and daughter came picked me up. Flight landed at 2:07 am. We got home at 0438 am. I won\\'t try to fly to Harrisburg until COVID is I Over and free pay checks stop flowing like free water. No one wants to go to work leaving thousands stranded in airports. This is a warning.   American Airlines constantly delays scheduled flights. If you need to get somewhere fast; don’t use AA. Customer Service is horrible on the plane. We sat on the runway for over 40 minutes waiting on a gate which makes it difficult if you have a tight connecting flight.   My husband and I flew from Philadelphia to LA yesterday on American and the inflight crew and service was the worst we have ever experienced. They finally got around to serving soft drinks and cookies about 2 hours into the flight. After that we pretty much never saw them again. My husband had to take his own trash to the galley where the flight attendant, who was busy reading a book, told him to put it in the trash can in the galley area without ever looking up. The restroom really needed some attention but the flight attendant who was sitting right outside (still reading her book) ignored it. Worst of all nobody came through the cabin to do a seatbelt check before we landed. Never had that happen before! We flew on 4 different American flights over our long weekend and the general attitude of the crews ranged from surly to indifferent. My husband is a lifetime platinum status flier with American but after this weekend we will be rethinking our choice of Airline for future trips.  I have been a loyal American Airlines passenger since 2007. I flew with them for both business travel and my personal travel. In the last 2 years or so, their customer service has plummeted. My final straw was this morning when, to not fault of AA, I missed my flight by one minute because of a delay in the Queens Tunnel and the TSA baggage screening system breaking down and chaos happening. However, their gate agent, was one of the most unhelpful, rude and downright hateful persons I have ever met. This is the third time in a row I have had to email a complaint because AA employees treat their passengers like garbage. I carry their credit card, I\\'m usually a Platinum or higher flyer and I currently have over 500,000 miles to show for my loyalty. I am now going to switch to Delta, where I have no status, because I will no longer give my money to a company that treats their passengers the way American does time and time again. I suggest anyone reading this do the same.   This is the worst airline. I took a break from them and here they are yet again very disappointing, delay every flight I had today. And waiting for another plane to unboard so that those people could catch this plane is beyond ridiculous. Waiting over 45 min for other passengers to board.  We should not have to suffer for other people. Will never use this airline again .   I see my grandson maybe twice a year. I do not appreciate my plane being late by an hour for no known reason. And therefore missing my connecting flight. I don’t like sitting in a random layover for an extra 8 hours, when I could be spending an evening with my grandson. The weather is fine and Covid excuses are getting old! Just be on time people.  This airline is awful. Do not use at all, especially if not a direct flight. My family was returning home from Orlando and just before boarding was to begin we were notified that the plane was running a few minutes late but connecting flights should be fine. Then we were told it would be a few more minuets because the plane landed on the wrong side of the airport. Once we finally got on the storm front had reached us, around 30 min after we were supposed to already be in the air. 3 hrs later we were forced to deplane. By this time our connecting flight was already gone. American Airlines logged the delay as due to weather and refused to book us on another airline so we were forced to take our first flight to Charlotte, 5 hrs after the original time, or risk not getting out from Orlando until Monday, 5 days later. Now that we are here there are no flights where we can stay together to travel so I have to take one of our 5 year olds to Phoenix for a 6.5 hr layover before finally getting to Minneapolis. My wife and our other two children have to sit at the airport from hotel check out till 4pm before their flight. American Airlines seems to have just used the weather to their advantage to get an easy out so my choices would be to fork out 4000 to fly home via delta with a 1 hr layover or take what American gave us. This is ridiculous and if you are reading this...stay away from American Airlines.   I went to the American Airlines desk at gate 4, PVD, to ask a question about my connection flight in Charlotte. A flight had just taken off a few minutes prior, so I waited while the woman walked away and took a 25 minute break. The man was busy helping get the flight to Philadelphia off. So when he finally was done I asked my question and he began to look up the information. In the meantime, she returned and rudely told me that they just got another flight off and basically told the man to not answer my question. Then she walked off and took another half hour break. No customer service here. Just, “poor me, I didn’t have enough of of a break!”. Not flying AA again. We paid a lot for first class tickets and can’t even get a question answered!  I continue to be disappointed with the service on American Airlines. I am a million mile customer, currently with Platinum status and I travel for both work and pleasure. I fly several different airlines, however living in Miami, American has good schedules. I do want to note, that the inflight service has been getting worse over the years and is at an all time low right now. No consistency between flights, crew members are cranky and unwilling to help and if you run into any service disruptions they basically turn their back and walk away. It\\'s very upsetting to be treated this way as a loyal customer. I have other choices to fly, and I am starting to move away from American like many in this area - just because they are the biggest in Miami, does not mean they are the only option.   The ground crew at American Airlines in CT tried to pass off my pillow in a pillowcase as a bag. Then they demanded I check the carry-on, I said it had all my medications. They refused to listen to me even when I said it was TSA certified. I had to unload my meds into shopping bags and then watch as they took my bag away without a luggage tag. Then in O\\'Hara the connecting flight had to u-turn it back to Chicago where we were told to please wait while they were diagnosing a problem. They gave us $12 for food where almost the entire terminal was closed. And $12 in an airport is nothing. They would not cancel the flight and it kept being delayed from Saturday night to Sunday morning at 1030, then 330p. I called the airline but everything was closed at 430a. So I had to use a old fashion phone box in the customer assistance program to get me on a united flight at 730a on Sunday. This came after they said that they lost the luggage because the plane rolled away with our bags on it. I did talk to customer assistance and they said they would deliver my bags. A week later I only have my main original bag but not my carry-on. They said because it had been over a week with no one claiming it it was sent to their warehouse. I have been on the phone, chatting, emailing, and contacting them like crazy and still nothing. If I ever get my bag back I will be grateful but I won\\'t use American again.  I would also like to add that I cannot get reimbursed as almost everything in the bags was on the \"Cannot Reimburse\" list.   \\r\\nI am continuously less than impressed with American. Going to avoid flying them in the future if possible. They’re always changing flights and when asked for any type of compensation (meal voucher for flight changes) I am always denied. I’ve never been impressed by American’s service. Sad to say the 3/10 rating is accurate.   I call them Thursday around 6pm the night before my flight and confirm everything 2 adults and 1 minor everything was fine seats number 31-A,B and C. When at the airport to check in next afternoon they had changed our seats to 31A 31C and 21K my wife and a minor with a passenger in the middle and the other seat 10 rows in front? I didn’t even mention the my flight going on vacation they canceled it 15 minutes after boarding time.   Trip to Spain was canceled due to covid. No fault of mine. AA refuses to refund my money. They got billions in tax payer money during covid and now they are stealing my money.   Only reason we flew with this airlines was because they advertised direct flights after purchased both flights were given layovers, but most importantly during this time of pandemic they think they don’t have to follow the safety rules and precautions for their customer and staffs health! Both me and my girlfriend tested positive for covid 19 after being on there packed flight from Miami to Boston, they had all of us sitting next to strangers instead of seats right next to each other and it was a full plane. We previously tested negative to get on the flight from Punta Cana to Miami. Never flying AA again   I will never take this airline again. It is my first and last time. Very unorganized! I have been stuck at the airport for over 12hrs. And can’t make it home for another two days. First one of their planes are unable to fly. After I had a 5hr layover, mind you, the plane was there before I got there. I was sitting at the gate the entire time. Now I missed my connection flight. When they made us get off the plane, they told us to go to gate D5. We were coming from gate D35. It took nearly 15 minutes to get there. Then they say it’s not a flight for people who have a connection flight. So they send us to gate D11. There was no one there. Finally found someone who says we’re supposed to be at gate D15. Then I have to stand in line for 30 minutes to get my flight changed just to tell me I can’t can’t make it home for an additional day or two. Now that it’s time for me to take my flight to Dallas we are sitting here on the plane for an additional hour. We’ve yet to take off because of another inconvenience.   Great service. Very prompt. The ticketing agent and staff went above and beyond to accommodate me. They were very understanding and patient. I have flown many times throughout my life on many different airlines and I wanted to make a point to leave a positive review because of how helpful they were. Thanks! Will definitely fly American again!   We made a huge mistake of trying to save a few dollars and fly with American airlines. They will never  get another dollar from me. The staff at the gates were the rudest bunch of people I\\'ve ever had the misfortune of having to deal with. On several occasions they made elderly customers sob. The flights with the exception of one flight attendant (had a layover) were the rudest people ever! Every single time they pushed the carts around I got hit on the knees or arms. I get it no problem there, but say sorry and apologize.  A person behind me bumped into a male flight attendant and you would have thought the world was going to end. The guy got extremely angry with the customer! On our adventure home our flight got canceled. Ok not the end of the world. Book a later flight same day whatever, but American Airlines moved our flight from that day to the next without any warning! We were lucky and checked the app often! We were lucky and caught it. We had to pay to get home that day. This company again will never get my business again, and I can promise after watching and listening to people around us they lost a lot of repeat business and respect. Do yourself a favor fly a different airline or drive, take a train, bus, boat.   After reading the reviews posted, perhaps I got off \"light\" with American Airlines. 8 hours late to final destination after they cancelled my flight and booked me on another airline. Charged me $30 dollars for a checked bag. Oh by the way the other airline also charged me for the same bag to the same destination.   Absolutely horrible and they don’t care about you! American Airlines screwed me over delaying multiple flights to and from Dallas Fort Worth making you completely miss the connection. Then sit in line for 2 hours to figure it out and they just stick you on a flight the next day with a 9 hour layover in yet another airport with a child who is allergic to most basic foods. They give you $12 a person for food and hotel by the time we were done at customer service we had 4 hours to get back between drive time with the shuttle we got 2hours of sleep! So pretty much have been stuck in airports for over 24 hours and every single person in the airport is unbelievably rude! And “it’s not their problem” but here take a standby seat but you need to you seat separately from your 3 year old.   American Airlines suck. My flight got canceled and i was forced to choose another flight that is a total inconvenience. 4 hour wait in the phone and when tried to get help at the airport was told that all other flights are full even though online they are still selling tickets for them. I\\'ll never use them again as its not the first time they have done this. Plus they refused to give me a reason why my flight was canceled. Choose your airline wisely. Total joke of an airline.   My first flight and I have no complaints. I lost my ID on the plane somehow, and they were kind enough to mail it to me. I was pleased with my experience.   My family and I got screwed out of our tickets and had to eat additional charges. We had our flights booked for months and this morning (travel day) our flight was canceled for “maintenance.” (Meaning American Airlines not fill the flight enough even though they claim they are worried about COVID.) We were told ALL other flights going to Maine for the next two days were completely booked. The only option was we could stop in Philadelphia for two days for a layover. This would result in us losing two days of our trip. Nothing was offered to compensate for this greedy mistake. No hotel voucher, nothing!! When we started saying we were going to call partner airlines of American Airlines the unapologetic lady changed her tune and said she would look for us. She was suddenly able to find a flight (for tonight) where we travel all night on United. This flight was also an additional $200 dollars which she stated would not be covered for them cancelling our first flight that we already paid for. We are still losing a day of our vacation too. My next phone call will be to the rental car place in Maine since that will now have to change too. I am so sick of these airlines treating their passengers like cattle. Yet they claim they are hurting with the pandemic! Save your pennies and book with another airline.  I recently had the worst experience with AA at the Newark Airport. I complained and requested for at least travel credit as I lost over $1100 as we missed our flight. We even checked in, had our boarding passes and seats assigned, we encountered a series of unfortunate events that left us feeling frustrated and emotionally distressed. Despite making prior communication with the gate agent, the airline departed from the gate before 2 p.m., causing us to miss our flight. My elderly dad got lost at the airport, didn\\'t have his passport and security helped him and called me to come to the security check with his passpot as he left the gate and he speaks very little english! He was scared and panicked, TSA helped him quickly to get in, even though we were at the gate before 2 and my mom and sister were waiting there and let the agent know that we found our dad and requested to wait for 5 mnts. The gate agent was incredibly rude and dismissive, and she said she would not let us in as the boarding is done and gate was closed, and we have to wait as she was busy with other customers and insisted that we seek assistance at the ticket counter customer service. This lack of empathy and professionalism only added to our distress. Upon reaching the ticket counter at AA customer service, we were informed that nothing could be done and we have call customer service as they can not help with anything one agent even was so rude, said to us that they can\\'t talk to us only can help if we have bags to check in. I almost cried and reached out to several agent over the phone, the only agent was helpful was ANGELO through chat service. I have requested to give some compensation as I am a AA advantage member. They said they can only give me 7500 points and I spent in total $1151.92. How this is a good customer service and how come a member can loose this much funds. I don\\'t think I would ever reccommend AA to anyone.  I always fly with American Airlines. This time will be my last. Understaffed and delayed flights are common for American now. I flew from LAX to OKC and along with a delayed flight I was welcomed with a very rude staff. I will not fly with American again.   Due to weather problems, I missed my flight Sunday evening and then my re-booked flight (the next night!) was actually cancelled. The airline has minimal live customer service and I was directed to rebook on the website or mobile app. However, the they were not working properly and I was not able to rebook. Many other people were automatically re-booked, but for some reason I was not able to. After my 2nd flight was cancelled, and I was unable to re-book myself, I went ahead and bought a ticket for the next available flight. Naturally that part of the app worked fine. It was a good thing I did, because once their automated system finally rebooked, me, it was not until the next day again at 10pm! I requested a refund or voucher for the price difference between the cancelled portion of my trip, and the increased cost for the last minute ticket. They declined me saying they never do any refunds but hoped I would be a loyal customer. Needless to say I am definitely not a loyal customer any more.   Worst flight experience ever with AA. I arrived with a 5 hours delay and my luggage was delivered 8 days after my arrival (8 days)! As a result I had no Christmas present for most of my families (they were in the suitcase) and had to buy loads of items. No compensation was even mentioned from them. The cause of the delay was a chaotic organization at the New Orleans airport. I was there 3 hours before my flight but they failed to check me in before flight time at 11am, like many other people in the flight. The check-in queue was completely disorganized with loads of people with flights in the afternoon getting checked in before the people in the 11am flight. I ended up spending 15 hours at the airport, arrived 5 hours late at my final destination, and my luggage was delivered 8 days later. Absolutely avoid flying with them on transatlantic journey. European companies may be slightly more expensive but they are accountable by law in case of major delay or inconvenience. AA clearly just don\\'t care.  I booked a flight from LAX to ALB which consisted of one stop/layover in Chicago. Due to there not being enough crew on the plane, my flight from LAX to Chicago was delayed over an hour. Once we actually boarded the plane, the flight was delayed further as the luggage sat outside the plane for 20 minutes while numerous employees walked by. Because of this, I missed my layover and was stuck in Chicago overnight. After getting off the plane at midnight, alone, lost, and confused in an airport I’ve never been in, I had to stand on an hour-long line to speak with customer service. They did accommodate me with a hotel room and transportation, however, the line for a taxi (transportation) was another hour-long wait due to the fact that the people with transportation vouchers were put at lowest priority after those paying with cash. This was genuinely the worst flight experience I’ve ever had and I will not be flying American again.   I am writing this message as a very frustrated customer. I have attempted to be patient but when American Airlines lack of commitment to deliver, poor on-time scheduling, and frequent cancelations on flights cause issues where they affect my livability and work it is a severe issue. I expected to board my flight (AA2915) at 3:28PM; however, upon my arrival to the airport I came to find out my flight had been cancelled. I was patient with the agent but when they advised me that the earliest they could get me out on a guaranteed seat was Thursday, I had no option but to go on stand-by. This was havoc since the passengers that were not able to fly were also on standby, so it was a hefty list. I was unable to board the 5’ish flight since it was overbooked by over 30 people. My original ticket was to leave Tampa and my destination was Columbia, SC. I spoke to the agent downstairs once again since the gate agents were bombarded by people and pleaded because I needed to leave that Sunday, and the agent was very condescending which I grew very irritated. They gave me a ticket for 6AM the next day to just go to Charlotte on standby and I will drive 2hrs from there. That is the extent of frustration, and disappointment due to the unreliability in travel arrangements is costing me. The following day I got to the airport bright and early to finally board a flight and TSA did not let me through since they stated my ticket was not valid and it did not have a gate. I explained this is the ticket that was issued to me and they apologized but could not let me through. I had to go back down to the terminal and once again wait in line for 30 minutes and have the agent go through their process. They told me I will be missing the flight and they will reschedule me again. This is the 4th attempt! I travel frequently for work and only use 2 airlines but the fact that every time I fly American there seems to be an issue even when the weather is good. Both days there were sunny skies and clear of clouds. If it staff issues I recommend hiring more reliable people, if it is maintenance hire more techs, if it is operations the get them retrained. Time is money and I had to lose a day of pay, get lectured by other people because now I look unreliable. Now American is literally tarnishing with my livelihood and my hard-earned reputation. This has happened to me 3 times in Texas and now once in Florida. It is either extended delays over 12hrs or cancellations. Now to add to it I have to drive 2hrs to get to my final destination.   Day 1 Flight Cancelled, lost out on VRBO and 1 day in Mexico. Day 2. missed out on Mexico because day 2 was a nightmare and missed our connecting flight. Day 2 Flight delayed from 7:00 AM--6:00 PM. Had to install a new captain\\'s chair and had to read a 300 page manual.  Had us board the plane for 2 hours and then deplane as the de-icer was not working. Get back on the plane at 6:00 PM and arrive at Dallas at 8:30 and lose our luggage. Talked to American Airline Rep and she PROMISED our luggage would be in Cozumel. Not the case Day 3--Flight gets delayed again and moves to a new flight. Supposed to land in Dallas on time and make a connecting flight. No chance in hell with this airline. Get 20 minutes from Dallas and the captain says that he lost our navigation system and have to land in Tulsa, OK. Keep us on the plane for more than 4 hours. Wait for another plane and get off the plane outside and board another flight to Dallas. Arrive in Dallas at 11:45 PM and miss out on another flight. Take a taxi and book a room. After booking a room American Airlines sends us a text with hotel vouchers and the hotel won\\'t take the voucher because we already paid. Day 4 Flight gets delayed and finally get back home.   American is the worst airline in existence. They have zero respect for anyone’s plans. It’s a guaranteed delay to your flight every single time for one reason or another. Today’s flight was supposed to take off at 07:30. An announcement was made in the terminal at 07:10 explaining they don’t know where the flight crew is immediately followed by an hour delay. How can you trust an airline that doesn’t even know where their flight crew is?! I don’t care if I have to take two connecting flights to get to my destination on another airline. This is absolutely the last time I fly American.  Worst Experience during a time of sorrow. Booked with American with a connecting flight via Contour. Contour cancelled the flight on 27 Oct into PAH. Was offered a new flight into Evansville, IN or Nashville TN at 6:30PM, this flight was 6 Hours after my original flight was to depart. Why does that time matter, the time of sorrow was my fathers wake was 5-8PM, I was due to arrive in PAH at 12:45PM. The flights into Evansville and Nashville did not arrive until the same time as the next PAH flight at 7:45PM, the next PAH was was supposedly sold out. Flying into the 2 offered locations would require 2+ hrs driving and $500 in rental car expense, on a flight I could have booked through Southwest, Nonstop and $400 cheaper. Here is the issue, American Desk Agents, Phone agents, and Contour Phone Agents simply refused to contact each other. American rebooked me on the Nashville flight, without my knowledge, and Contour stating they can not make changes to American Itineraries, creating 6+ hrs of phone time between both Airlines, hobbling across 2 terminals on crutches to get to my family, In the end, I was forced to buy a 2nd seat on Contour, on a flight that was \"Sold Out\" to be told, I had 2 seats 20 minutes before boarding, which contour refused to refund, because I was cancelling within 24 hrs of the flight, but only 15 minutes after being told I didn’t have a seat. American and Contour refused to contact each other and American refused to talk to a Contour REP I had on the phone. Total 8 hrs on a 45 minute layover, $800+ dollars and a flight credit on an airline that flys no where. And what else - American refuses to entertain my refund request, stating it is Contours issue and American refuses to reply to any message. American Airlines Customer Service Agents on Terminal C on 3 NOV were the rudest, most unprofessional customers service REPs I have ever experienced.   Worst airline I have ever used. Nothing but canceled flights, delayed flights, and rude or unhelpful customer service. Delayed so many times we missed 2 different connecting flights. Switched to southwest and no delays. \\xa0\\xa0Lacking consistency. I\\'m often feeling lack of appreciation of business given. I fly every week with American Airlines for the last couple years and was excited to earn that status I have. Pretty disappointed so far. Initially I passed my frustrations off due to the pandemic, understanding the added stress the staff had to go through but I guess that became the new norm. My company gives us choice of preferred airline and the majority of my company flies Delta. It\\'s been an ongoing joke difference of the level of perks, appreciation and treatment that Delta gives over American. Delta flyers get free sky club, while I have to pay for Admirals club, Delta give free clear membership while i have to pay, delta gives free recheck while i have to pay. Delta can use mile for flight changes, I cant with American. No wonder Delta flyers are happy and loyal. Although I had made the decision to be loyal to AA, I\\'m not happy and I\\'m getting tired of seeing the satisfaction of my co workers while I\\'m left feeling wanting. I guess it\\'s about time to consider what continues to be recommended, making a status change. Delta you look more and more appealing every week.  The flight was delayed multiple times, and in the end, the flight was diverted to JFK. Gate personnel are rude and unprofessional. Gladly changed the flight to the following day but seats that were reserved on the original flight were not available and the airline tried to charge me extra for them when seats where available.   After finding the gate to get on the plane, they changed the gate. This happened four times. I had to walk back and forth several times. They also changed my seat, and it was not social distancing for the COVID-19. plane was almost full and I was assigned to sit next to a stranger. There were a few seats open in the back that were empty. I will never fly American Airlines again.   American should have their flight certificate revoked! I am delayed, and missing a connection, because they cannot calculate the weight distribution properly. For goodness sake, that is the first thing you learn in flight school. Their people treat you like dirt and have no customer focus. If you book on American you deserve the problems you will have to endure.   Trip was delayed then canceled then rescheduled but too late for anyone to make connections. Employees were short, insensitive and rude. I lost my family weekend vacation to the Canyon. Such an awful experience. Glad the rest of the family flew Spirit. They made it just fine.   Flight delayed from 11:00 AM to 5:45 PM. We stayed on the plane for 2 hours with multiple engine failures. After finally deplaning us we had to wait for new pilots which took about another hour or two. Then we were told the cabins were too hot and needed to cool down which took another 2 hours. We were told little to nothing and received no help or vouchers. Staff was rude and told us to be nice because they extended their work days for us. Not even acknowledging a literal 6+ hour delay which caused majority of every passenger to miss plans and left me and my partner without a ride.   American Airlines lost my wheelchair and didn\\'t take responsibilities. And nobody even apologized. All I asked was that my wheelchair was to be ready at the door when I arrived. Nobody even thought to double check and when there was clearly a problem, instead of coming forth with it and apologizing they made me wait for so long even though I had connecting flight. And then blamed others for the problem saying \"I was in an airplane so I couldn\\'t have known.\" They really wanted to get me off their sight, and passed me away to airport workers. The manager did come but he didn\\'t say anything.  Had airport workers not found my wheelchair, my whole trip was entirely ruined, like how was I supposed to enjoy the trip without means to walk?   I usually fly American, however this is the 3rd time my flight has been delayed. In a row, causing me to miss my connecting flights, all 3 times. Then, I was rebooked on flights the next day. Unacceptable, especially when I\\'m on a tight schedule. I\\'ll be changing airlines for future flights until things get back up to standard.   Allowed my son to travel (minor) with American Airlines on a domestic flight, after our stellar experience with Avianca out of the country. Oh my goodness was I wrong to do so. Arrived three hours early for his flight, when the recommendation was 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Long lines at baggage check got him within 1 hour of boarding time once he hit TSA. He was nervous it was now cutting it close and called me, so I told him to simply mention it to an employee and he was assured it would be ok. One of the TSA agents pulled him aside because he looked \"nervous\" and held him up until he had missed the flight. This isn\\'t even the complaint. It\\'s what happened next. I told him to go to the customer service desk and let me speak with the attendant - as he was a minor and couldn\\'t make his own flight changes. The customer service rep told me he would not speak to me period, or allow me to be on the phone with my son while he made his arrangements and told my son to hang up on me. When my son called me back, they had re-routed him from coming home to Chicago, where all outgoing flights had been cancelled due to weather. I then attempted to contact American Airlines customer support to be sure he would not be sent somewhere he had no family, American Airlines told me if a minor is traveling (he\\'s 17 and just cannot make airline ticket purchases without an adult not a child) they can do whatever they want with his destinations and whether or not they allow him a flight at all without parental consent. I hate this company\\'s policy of directly not caring about the safety of its passengers.   A tragedy of a company at SFO. After not accepting the way our initial negative COVID-19 PCR test results were shown on paper (despite our final destination\\'s approval, and re-approval), they took so long to review our results that they literally closed the flight while we were standing there. Keep in mind, we had already been there for over 2hrs trying to explain that the test was valid, had already contacted our doctors emergency line and had them update it once to the AA manager\\'s original requirements, only to show the updates to them and for them to say that they needed something else. All this took so long that the flight closed, even though they originally said they would make an exception for us to board. Both managers at AA SFO are completely incompetent and impossible to work with. We called the local authorities at our destination today and had them confirm verbally, via their authorization portal, as well as via email that our original tests, as well as the ones we paid $500 each for were acceptable to enter the country. It\\'s almost insulting as well that the managers at American Airlines joked about the validity of the local authority\\'s authorization process - in order for us to enter the country, we have to submit a negative COVID-PCR test. Which we have done. The manager said that the process was not valid and the country just \"auto-approved\" every request they got. I raised this with the local authorities on a call today and they said that was totally wrong. I mean why have this whole process to just auto-approve everyone who submits? We have now paid over $1300 to get rapid COVID PCR tests and more, only to have no way to confirm with the airline if these will fly, even though we have written confirmations and confirmation from the CDC that these tests are valid COVID-19 PCR tests. On top of that, American has offered no compensation or other options, we are out as I mentioned over $1300, had to have our flights downgraded, 24 hours delayed, not to mention the rude staff and stress of it all. Save yourself the hassle and fly United or Jet Blue. Or literally anything else like Southwest or Delta. Do not book on American Airlines if you can help yourself. The attitude of the staff is the last thing we all need in this extremely challenging year already. People like the managers at SFO American Airlines have something else coming for them. Fair warning to all future travelers.   Killeen to Seattle via Dallas . The staff are unfriendly and sometimes flat out rude. They don\\'t smile, they aren\\'t happy to see you and I always feel very unwelcomed when flying with AA. I will only fly with them when I have to (for work), but when I do, I dread having to fly with them. Flying for work sucks anyway, their awful customer service just makes it that much more of a terrible experience.   Wow! I just read a review of American that sounds a lot like my experience! My daughter and I traveled to Key West just for 3 days, so all we had were carry-ons. In spite of purchasing tickets in November, we were group 7 boarding. Upon boarding in Miami, we were told that we had to check our carry-ons due to \"weight distribution.\" I was fuming! Upon arrival in Key West, we had to wait over 25 minutes for our luggage. Because of this, friends who came to pick us up couldn\\'t wait, so we had to pay for a taxi to take us to our B&B! I called American later the same night and was told that the agents at the gate told me \"3 times that the bins were full!\" What a bunch of liars! The bin above us had one piece of luggage in it, the bin across from us was completely empty, there were other bins with space on the way down to our seats. They are blatant liars! I have had stuff stolen from my luggage in the past and pack all my electronics, make-up, medication, etc in my carry-on so it\\'s in my possession at all times! I don\\'t use a lock on my carry-on due to the fact that this carry-on is going to be in my possession. I will never use this airline again. I will fly Southwest (my favorite airline) to Miami and rent a car and drive to Key West. Absolutely infuriated!  NEVER fly American. Our flights were delayed both to our destination and coming home. 99% of the staff are extremely unhelpful if not rude. They do not care to help and say do it through the app or call customer service and they do not help either. Our experience to our destination was absolutely terrible but coming back I was hopeful it was just a bad experience and this would be better…just to have a very similar experience. Again I cannot emphasize enough how unhelpful the staff is and how rude they are. Spend the extra money to fly an airline that you know will care about getting you where you need to be. I’d give a zero overall but this won’t let me.   Late take off due to weather so they said arrived to late in Charlotte plane to Memphis had already left before we landed. The customer service were rude is the best way I could put it. So we were offered a standby maybe on a flight the next day but it was a maybe at best and then we were told it would be Sunday. Keep in mind this was a planned weekend in Memphis ...by the time we would have gotten there it would be time to come back. To be honest and put it in a nice way the weather was not their fault but they need to be better trained to handle these types of situations. I ended up having to pay 200 dollars for the only room available in the city of Memphis at 1AM and paying 40 dollars for a cab to get here because it was the ONLY option. First started with a four hour delay even though we were the very first flight out. Which then made us miss our connecting flight. Our only option was a 6 hour layover which was then delayed twice and has become a 8 hour layover. We missed our wedding rehearsal and dinner and now have to get a rental car. We called American and they were the least bit apologetic or helpful. All of this for poor seats in a very old outdated plane and nasty cookies and not very friendly people. Will never fly American again unless they make it right with us. Which is doubtful.   Nia Wilson, customer service manager at American in Charlotte is amazing. She noticed our group of 34 and helped us to rebook our cancelled flight. She took us every step of the way-from getting us a private bus to take us to our hotel, to getting that same bus to come pick us up the next day to take us back to the airport, to getting us food at Chick-Filet while we waited for our new flight. She got permission to switch out a plane so our group would fit on a flight to get us home from an 8-day trip to the East Coast with middle and high school students. She is awesome and we are so grateful we met her and she helped us.   American Airlines never updated the Boarding Passes and the Gate was wrong. In addition, the gate listed on the board was incorrect. Despite these inconsistencies and rushing to several incorrect gates, we finally made it to our correct gate with 11 minutes to spare. The only problem was that staff had given our seats away and would not allow us to board. If someone makes an appt for something and shows up early, why on God\\'s green earth would those spots be given away? These two gate assistant treated us like it was our fault and were rude on top of everything else. It\\'s sad that there likely will be no repercussions for this type of treatment.   American Airlines don\\'t care about their passengers in flight. This was the most painful seat I ever traveled on. Their seats are made for children only in economy. Think twice before booking economy on American Airlines Boeing 737. They don\\'t care about their customers.   Wonderful plane. Very big and roomy. Not full. Flew from Cancun to Dallas Fort-Worth. Great trip in no time at all. Then transferred to an Airbus to Seattle. Horrible trip. Small uncomfortable plane. Last row in back. Could smell bathrooms and exhaust from plane. Poor flight attendants are stuck back there as well, can\\'t be healthy for any of us, its all about the money on those lousy planes.   Absolutely appalled and infuriated by our horrendous ordeal with American Airlines. Our management team has been stranded in Charlotte, NC, for over a grueling 10 hours, following what was supposed to be a brief stopover from Grand Rapids. The behavior of American Airlines staff in Grand Rapids was deplorable, obnoxious, and utterly dismissive. They seemed to find it completely acceptable to extend a mere 45-minute layover to an interminable 10-hour wait, without so much as a blink of an eye. Their attitude was appalling. Upon our weary arrival in Charlotte, a glimmer of hope was provided by a lounge representative who revealed that, contrary to what we were told in Grand Rapids, we could have been booked on earlier flights home. Seats were available, yet we were misled to believe otherwise. During the endless hours spent in Charlotte, conversations with various airport employees, restaurant workers, and shop attendants painted a stark picture of American Airlines’ reputation—delayed flights and a glaring disregard for customer service seem to be the norm, leading many to question how they remain in operation. It’s downright disgraceful. We are resolved to never fly with American Airlines again and strongly advise others to steer clear of them. Their indifference to our situation caused us to miss crucial meetings, showing a blatant lack of concern for their passengers’ time and commitments. A truly disgusting experience.   Horrible customer service from the American airline employee that checks your tickets as you board the plane. This was the rudest encounter I have ever had at an airport. I will never fly American again. I paid a lot of money for my family’s plane tickets, to be treated like that. They should be training their employees to not treat people so poorly.   This was the absolute worst experience I have ever had flying. Rude staff, not on time, and wasted my entire day at the airport. Our initial flight was supposed to leave sometime around 10. We got to the airport around 8 to check in and immediately our flight was delayed by 3 hours. The next soonest flight was not until 4 and we were unable to make it to our destination until 9. We spent 11 and a half hours at the airport doing absolutely nothing because we can’t afford the airport food. Absolutely unacceptable. Then on the way home same issue. We got on our plane to leave and ended up sitting for an hour waiting for it to take off causing us to miss our connection and be unable to get on another plane until 9 o clock. Every time I attempted to get help or assistance from staff they were rude and on top of that I was not given the free food vouchers I was promised for a flight delayed beyond 3 hours. Thanks for ruining our entire vacation. Never again will I fly American Airlines.  Arriving 2.5 hours early, I’ve never seen this level of absolute chaos. The counter line was shockingly massive and moving at a snail’s pace. When it was finally my turn, 3 hours later (9:15 am), I was informed no seats were available to make it to Belize that day. Lucky I had the foresight to check backup flights while stalled in the long waiting line. I was told it would not be possible to reach Belize that day! I explained how there were absolutely seats available and requested to speak with the manager. After a long wait, the same agent returned. There were two optional flights out of Austin with seats available, but she refused to acknowledge these open seats, in both of the flights to Dallas and also availability on a later flight from Dallas to Belize. After 20 more minutes and constantly on the phone, she explained since I hadn’t booked a hotel, I would be required to quarantine for 24 hours, if flights were even available. I explained this was not the case according to the Belizean government’s webpage, as well as the Aggressor fleet company. After another 15-20 minutes on the phone and running around talking with supervisors, she found this was not true and now wasted another 30 minutes of time. This uniformed agent had now foolishly misused the precious time needed to make the first of the two available flights. After another 20 minutes, now almost an hour at the ticket counter, I was issued boarding pass. Even then, the agent warned it was likely I would miss the connecting flight in Dallas. Once in Dallas, was forced to literally run 25 gates (39 to 14), with a 30 lbs backpack in only 10 minutes, not an easy task when you’re 67. They were preparing to close the gate as I arrived and barely reached my seat before take off. Check your records and please explain why dozens, if not hundreds of fliers, arriving over 2 hours early, missed their flight that morning, The original letter was 5 times longer, but had to omit so much to submit.    I am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with the recent experience my family and I had with American Airlines. We were booked on a flight from Miami to JFK Airport that was unexpectedly canceled due to weather conditions. While I understand that weather-related cancellations are sometimes unavoidable, the handling of the situation was unacceptable. After the cancellation, my wife, our two young children (ages 3 and 5), and I were left stranded in Miami. We spent an agonizing six hours in line just to speak to a representative, only to be told that the next available flight was three days later. I explained to your staff that I would lose my job if I could not return home on time, but no alternative solutions were offered. Given the urgency of our situation, I decided to rent a car and drive from Miami to New York. However, when I attempted to retrieve our luggage, I was informed that it had already been sent on another flight to JFK. This was incredibly frustrating, as it clearly demonstrated that there were flights departing for JFK, yet we were not accommodated on any of them. This entire ordeal has caused significant stress and inconvenience for my family, not to mention the financial burden of staying in Miami for an additional three days and the cost of a rental car. I am also concerned about the potential impact on my employment due to the delay. Given the circumstances, I kindly request a full explanation of why we were not offered an alternative flight sooner, despite the fact that our luggage was sent to JFK. Additionally, I am seeking compensation for the additional expenses we incurred as a result of this situation, including the cost of the rental car and any other associated costs. I have been a loyal customer of American Airlines, but this experience has left me questioning my choice of airline. I hope that you will take this complaint seriously and provide a satisfactory resolution.   Bought my tickets through Travelocity in July 2020 for a great price. AA changed the return flight times from 1.10 to 3.28 back in Oct 2020. I never received any notification. That change left me with 1 hour and 14 minutes to go through customs and meet my connecting flight in Miami. I contacted AA and they put the blame on Travelocity. I understand Travelocity should have notified me but AA made the changes that are impossible to keep. AA customer service wouldn\\'t even talk to me. When we arrived at the FPO airport to come home the AA ticket person looked at this ridiculous schedule and changed us to a flight where we were now leaving Miami the next day. Keep in mind I am 59 and my husband is 63. I asked her if we are supposed to sleep on the airport floor. She told me to talk to the people at Miami. Because my tickets are now not connected I had to pick up my carry on in Miami and have it rechecked. AA wanted to charge me a second time for my checked baggage. I had to talk to those folks about the horrible mix-up that is all AAs fault before my baggage was accepted. Then they made me leave through a locking door into the terminal. I am no longer in the secure area. So now I not only have to sleep on the floor but I am now unable to access food. I tried to reenter but TA would not let me pass because our tickets were for tomorrow. The only saving grace for your horrible airlines was the manager in Miami. She was the first one in all of this nightmare that even bothered to listen to us. What should have been an easy flight home from a great vacation turned into hell! You really need to have customer service that listens to your customers instead of blowing us off to the next stop. This could have all been avoided if you didn\\'t allow changes that were impossible to keep. That is all on you!   On our way to Spain they boarded us into a plane with no A/C for more than an hour, knowingly, because they apologized for it (this is august in Dallas…100Fº! I thought I was going to pass out from the heat; for 9 hours and 45 min the A/C never really worked, this is with a mask and sitting in between 2 strangers, because they split us all up to be able to charge us $100 extra per person to be able to sit together with your family, which obviously I refused to pay having already payed thousands for our tickets. On our way back from Madrid we changed planes in Dallas. As soon as we landed we got a text saying our flight to Houston had been canceled, we had to practically beg to get a spot for the 4 of us on the next flight. They treated us as if it was our fault the flight was canceled and now we have to beg as if we hadn’t payed for our tickets. One of the counter people told a lady: “do you know what stand by means? So stand by (with a hand gesture as in move away) this lady was alone with 4 small children! I forgot, one of our bags didn’t arrive, so the next day my husband had to drive back to the airport (1 hour away from home) to get the bag, jet lag and all! American Airlines is by far the worst airline I’ve ever used, and I travel a lot, I’ve used all airlines, except Alaska which I’ve heard is awesome! I hope I don’t have to ever use it again. Oh, and the food tastes like feet, bring your own if you can.   Probably the worst experience I have had. I am literally writing this review while i’m still on the plane waiting to get off of it. The staff that was on this plane, also the one from LA to Miami: has to be the bitterest, most impatient crew I have ever met. One of the flight attendants actually told me to “hurry up” while I was peeing. We asked for headphones multiple times and from multiple staff members, by the time one of them gave it to us she said we are asking way too many times and driving them crazy. Every time I tried to speak to one of them they either rolled their eyes, or walked off as I\\'m still speaking. Not sure why these people hate life or why they so bitter to others.   My flight has been canceled for the second time. My dog was picked from the pet hotel hours before I was supposed to arrive home. Now she’s home alone. I canceled on my job due to the first delay and now due to the second delayed I will have to cancel again. I am afraid I might get fired. This is a horrible experience. My mother was supposed to refill her medication back home and now we are stranded in Phoenix again, never again!   Had to cancel this flight due to new Covid restrictions but the airline doesn’t care to accommodate and cooperate with the created situation, unbelievable scammers. Ripped off my $240! Will never fly American again and don’t recommend it to anyone!   Even with a five hour delay due to staffing issues, American Airlines did a fabulous job. There is really nothing to complain about when you’re flying onboard a 6 year old Boeing 787 in a premium economy seat for the price of an “extra legroom” seat on a domestic flight. The onboard crew was very polite and friendly and the ground staff was wonderful during this five hour delay. As we entered the plane they apologized to each individual passenger, and even issued everyone who asked a meal voucher. Once up in the air, the Captain apologized to everyone onboard over the PA system and even got us to Philadelphia ahead of the protected time of arrival. As someone who is constantly flying, the way American Airlines handled this entire delay was fantastic, I don’t understand what all that negative complaining is about. Good job, American Airlines!   Worst airline in the world. Never again I would travel through American Airlines. If I could give them negative stars I would, unfortunately I can’t. Don’t waste you’re time with them.  With 4 departure delays, you would expect the gate agent to at least be a neutral. After attempting to check in at the digital kiosk, we entered the line to check in. We were at the desk in a few minutes, it was not busy. We were practically barked at, \"Why aren\\'t you at the kiosk?\" I had the phone bar code ready - no good for her. So, another bark requesting our names. My sister was part of our party, not on the same cc. She was equally rude to her, not wanting to process her ticket.   AA customer service is horrible, they do not care about their consumers or any kind of family emergency (death in the family). We were told that they could not transfer our mothers seat to me however I could be booked on the same flight as my sister immediately after we cancelled our mothers seat, so we agreed and they screwed us over. Apparently they oversold the seats and weren\\'t able to do what they said, when speaking to a \"supervisor\" we were informed that the information given to us was incorrect. We also asked for different options to fly me out of a different location but they would give the same price as the original flight or even get to me to the other location. I had to figure this all out on my own. Sadly disappointed in their customer service and their lack of accommodations.   I am from the United States but teach in Thailand. Last Christmas, I was back in the United States visiting family and friends. This was when COVID was absolutely rampant in the U.S. and ended up getting COVID while there and was very, very sick from it. At that time, to get into Thailand, you needed a negative PCR COVID test, which I didn’t have, for my original flight to get back to Thailand. I ended up having to change my flight twice because of all of this and missed more than a week of school because of it. It was extremely stressful, especially while being so, so sick from COVID like I was. The customer service I received when I needed to rebook my flight multiple times was phenomenal. That was all such a stressful situation, and dealing with American to rebook my flight could’ve been one more area of stress, but it wasn’t. And I was so, so thankful. I called later than I was supposed to one of the times because I was driving to the airport to see if maybe I would get my COVID test back in time while driving to the airport to make my flight. I didn’t get the test back in time but didn’t call right away to change my flight because I had a pounding headache that was turning into a migraine and was extremely exhausted. When I called a few hours later, the woman I spoke to was incredibly helpful and understanding and still allowed me to rebook my flight without having to pay for a new one. She didn’t give me a hard time or make me wait a long time. It’s almost a year later, and I still remember her kindness and am still so thankful for her and how she helped me in the midst of a really stressful, really hard situation. I felt like she really valued customers as people and understood how stressful air travel was at that time; she wasn’t just going by policies. She may have technically been “breaking the policy,” but she made me want to be a loyal customer to American. With all of my flights since, when American has been an option, I’ve chosen American almost every time. She made me feel valued and seen as a person. So if anyone from American reads these reviews, I want you to know showing understanding and care to your customers, like this woman did to me, is how you gain loyal customers. Work to keep your employees like her, and hire more like her!   Terrible experience. Waited in Charlotte after a 4 hour flight from Aruba. As the flight was called and everyone was lining up to board the flight was cancelled. Crew said it was because they didn’t have enough staff. How was there not enough staff and that was just discovered minutes before boarding?  The worst airline personnel at the check in and at the gate! Unprofessional, rude and totally out of touch with the needs of the First Class customers who are paying a premium for being treated courteously. My confirmed booking was for a later flight and I tried to leave on an earlier flight. They had first class seats when I checked online but at the airport they put me on stand-by. I was the very last person to be assigned a seat at the back of the plane when I had told the gate agent I was a First Class passenger. The gate agent was extremely rude, never listened to what I said to her and assumed as a First Class passenger it was going to be acceptable to me to fly in the middle seat at the back of the plane?! The ticketing agent never mentioned to me that the stand-by was a down grade to lowest fare economy which I would have declined in the first place. My preferred airline is Delta and this could be the last time I fly this lowlife airline!  I had a small carry on bag that I asked the guy in the front of the airplane if he could be kind enough to help me put it up. His response “I’m sure a make passenger can help you”. Sorry what? Isn’t this your job? I wouldn’t have asked if my doctor hadn’t told me I wasn’t able to carry anything over 10lb. I then proceed to my seat and asked the airline attendant if she could help me out it up and she gave me a confused look and said she can’t carry that. What are they even here for then, just for looks? Terrible service.   Every single employee I have encountered is just plain rude and hateful. The problem is, I have flown American the last 3 to 4 times I have flown (they are always the cheapest and I see why). They are always rude and hateful, I am so sorry that you hate your jobs! Thanks please get another one and let someone pleasant take your place. American, what are you doing to these people to make the hate everyone?   How not to be welcomed on to the plane by a hostess. Boarded flight from Maui to LA to be greeted by the air hostess say to both my sister and I ‘have you got a blanket to cover up?’, which we replied ‘No’, as apparently our sunburn was ‘going to hurt with the cold air conditioning there was on the plane’. This left both of us feeling very unwelcomed and feeling very worthless, despite us both being a priority and member of the one world frequent flyer programme - also thinking who is she to judge whether I’ve got a sunburn or not, when she doesn’t even know me. Clearly they have no idea how to treat their customers, let alone their frequent flyer members. In all my time of flying, I have never been spoken to in a very rude & personal way.   I am a college freshman and it’s not my first time flying AA. However, I do have a preference of who usually fly with. My flight was suppose to connect from Dallas to Memphis. While sitting on the plane awaiting to go home I saw for over 1 hour full of passengers at 1130pm which at that time was told there was a medical emergency with another flight. 15 mins later the pilots on my plane got off the plane and was told they reached their travel limit. Still sitting on the plane the airlines said we are working on getting new pilots. Finally new pilots came and the airline cancelled the flight, the line was long at the gate to find out how soon they could get me home. Way too long of a wait 30 people before me and 30 mins passed with now major communication from this airlines. I took the Greyhound bus home. As I boarded the bus I received an email after 1 in the morning that they rescheduled my flight for October 26th at 930pm! I would not have gotten home until almost Wednesday early morning. As I stated before I am a college freshman and a black female. I cannot afford to stay almost two days in Dallas a place I have never been and it would not have been comfortable to sleep in an airport.   Boarded the planes. The first leg left on time, second a little delayed bit wound up around 10 minutes late. Crew was nice, but nothing memorable. Connected in Dallas, which seems to have smooth operations. The American App was not working so we had to get paper boarding passes. Come on, American, you\\'re not Spirit! There was a power outlet, a type of USB port I believe was to plug your phone charger in, though I may be wrong, nonetheless, a port and outlet. The flight to CLE from DFW was on time which was nice. Unfortunately, though my first impression with American was in 2016 which was when A320 or A321 fleet had free entertainment and seatback screens which I hear they are in the process of removing in favor of streaming. Overall, both flights were nice and smooth, i\\'d take them over Spirit or Frontier any day if close in price, but i\\'ll stick to United for now. Why? Because unlike American, United has reversed course and has decided to bring seatback entertainment with a personal tv on every seat on their whole fleet by 2025. If American continues their current path, they will be the only Legacy Carrier without seatback entertainment, and we will fly them only if they are significantly cheaper than their competitors, Delta and United, as they were when we booked this flight. One aspect i\\'d like to give American credit for, were the gate agents helping us out at CLE Airpot. As a United frequent flyer, the friendly agents reminded me of the good old days of Continental. Maybe we just got lucky, but the team at the check in counter was super nice, which was a pleasant surprise for a 5:45 AM flight!  On flight #5884 12/11/20 the only female fight attendant on our flight was the most unprofessional and disrespectful flight attendant I’ve ever encountered on an airline! Our flight had to turn around right before landing due to trouble shooting. I was sleeping most of the flight. She kept coming over and rudely telling us we needed to follow the mask policy. Not one time did we remove our masks or take them off, we simply pulled them down to eat and drink. When our flight landed she tossed masks at us and said, \"since your masks must be too big for your faces since the keep falling down, here are some that fit. If you don’t wear your mask properly I’ll be sure that you never fly with American Airlines ever again.\" As a business owner I would never want someone so disrespectful, rude and unprofessional working for my establishment. Not only did we never remove our masks but the way the situation was handled if she felt we weren’t wearing them properly was completely wrong. She has terrible customer service skills and a negative and rude attitude. Not once did she communicate with us in a nice or professional manner. We’ll never fly American Airlines again.   My flight is not till the end of the month but I have been on the phone day and night everyday for 4-5 hours waiting for any representative to answer my call and no one did. No one called me back either. This is also happened when my son flew to New York we called and called and called and no one answered nor returned our calls. It’s very unprofessional and would never fly American Airline again. Just the fact that we’ve called everyday for the two weeks and for hours and hours of waiting on the phone and no one answered is very sad. It’s not acceptable. Very, very disappointed, and like I said I haven’t even left yet.   On the flight from Raleigh to Miami scheduled for 8:30 they told us that the pilot arrived late at the hotel and was resting so we had to wait a few minutes, 30/40 minutes later they made us get off the plane because he would not leave until 12:30, the Departure was after 1 pm, we lost connection to Lima. As a \"special thing\" in Vista that the flights were full, they gave us the last seats on the plane, super uncomfortable, scheduled to arrive at 5pm, we arrived after midnight, we lost the contracted mobility, and by saying sorry they thought they would fix all the problems caused. Today, June 13, we came to the airport after queuing for 1 hour, they told us to get out of the queue to make a new queue because our flight was not open since it was delayed, nobody notified us. When I told the person in charge of the queue when I got to the counter that it would be in another hour, it should be open now and they would be able to serve us, she replied very rudely that she would go to the other queue or call the supervisor to \"decide\" if we may or may not travel. The only thing that we are sure of is that we will not use this airline again, as customers we pay our tickets and expect consideration and respect, something that this airline does not know. En el vuelo de Raleigh a Miami programada 8:30 avisaron que el piloto llego tarde al hotel y estaba descansando asi que teniamos que esperar unos minutos, 30/40 minutos mas tarde nos hicieron bajar del avion pues no saldria hasta 12:30, la Salida fue pasada la 1 pm, perdimos conexion para Lima. Como \"cosa especial\" en Vista que estaban llenos los vuelos nos dieron asientos los ultimos del avion super incomodos, programados a llegar 5pm llegamos pasada la media noche, perdimos la movilidad contratada, y con decir sorry creyeron arreglaban todos los problemas causados. El dia de hoy 13 de Junio vinimos al aeropuerto despues de hacer cola de 1 hora, nos dicen salir de la cola hacer una nueva cola pues no estaba abierto nuestro vuelo ya que tenia retrazo, nadie nos notifico. Cuando le dije a la encargada de la cola cuando llegue al counter que sera en otra hora mas, ya debe estar abierto y nos podran atender, me contesto en forma muy descortes que hacia la otra cola o llamaria al supervisor para que \"decida\" si podiamos o no viajar. Lo unico que si estamos seguros es que no volveremos a usar esta linea aerea, como clientes pagamos nuestros tickets y esperamos consideracion y respeto, cosa que esta aerolinea no conoce.   Worst experience ever. Flight out of Dallas Fort Worth delayed 1 hour, maintenance issure, ok can understand, 20 minutes into flight told we were diverting and landing in Oklahoma City, all got off plane (this is at 10:30 pm), told it was a windshield issue, ok, it took them 3 hours to let us know or just heard it word of mouth through other passengers we were not leaving for 10 hours (this was at 1:30 am, basically a closed airport at this time), was offered a voucher for hotel, I made the decision to stay at the airport and find another flight, which I did, flew out at 8:00 am with Delta. Never again will I fly with American Airlines. I totally understand the maintenance issue, but not to be updated properly as to what was happening and the option that was given to us to fly 10 hours later was not acceptable for me. Do Not fly American Airlines.   My mom flew back from her trip and had a layover in Miami to Orlando and it was a nightmare to get her flight back to Orlando she ended up spending the night at Miami airport. After multiple times getting on and off of the plane she finally had to pay a taxi 1:30 AM to get to Orlando airport where her bag should be - however it’s on an 8:00 clock flight! How inconvenient and careless this airline is. We will not choose to travel with this airline ever again.   This is by far one of the worst travel experiences in my 48 years. They reserve the right to ban you from their flight for any reason. Their practice seems to be very inconsistent, bump people from their flight, non-refundable, and sell your seat to someone else. This seems to be their current business model. Everyone has the right to refuse service but common courtesy would be to notify us, not wait till we are stuck at the airport with no other means of getting home. I have two minor children depending on me and could not reach them. We were here for 6 days and could have booked another flight but we’re not notified. This goes beyond bad business practice.   San Jose to Eugene via Los Angeles. One of the worst travel experiences in 45 years:  Atrocious customer service from start to finish.  Inept, rude, and unresponsive management that avoids responsibility for poor service, which is mirrored by unsupported front line personnel, translating to a company that simply doesn’t care.  Delays of more than 4 hours for a 2 hour flight with no weather/disaster excuse... is inexcusable. Management knew, yet kept everyone (50 people ages 4 months-84 years) waiting with consecutive delays totaling 4 hours before cancelling flight....at 1 AM in the morning, leaving us stranded in the middle of the night with very limited rebook options within the next 12 hours. I could have driven faster and for less expense (even in a rental). Transportation is a service, and we have many choices. I will never fly American Airlines again.   4 flights in 3 days not a single one of they was on time. 3 were delayed for maintenance. I will never fly this airline again.   Delay - sat at gate for a repair. Delay - had to abort landing, runway had heavy traffic. Ran to next gate for connecting flight only to have door shut in our faces, with gate agent saying sorry too late. We had more then 10 minutes to take off time. Planes are out dated. No beverages, no snack, no in-flight entertainment. Customer service was swamped, hundreds of people stranded by the delays. Our turn at counter, no hotels, no compensation. They would put us on another flight the next day on standby at 12.30pm or a flight at 7.20pm. Who cares - stranded with no clothes, no food, no place to sleep. Really American get it together, covid is not an excuse.   I am an at risk senior traveling for my 95 year old father\\'s funeral so travel was not an option for me. I am very upset that the plane was so full. It was my understanding that guidelines state the middle seats are supposed to be left empty to allow for social distancing due to coronavirus. On my flight on Sunday 5/17/2020 Ord to AZ American flight #AA601 the middle seat was left empty however that was not the case on the return flight on Sunday 5/24/2020 American flight #AA883 Phx to Ord. I am very unhappy that I was exposed more than I should have been because American put profit ahead of my safety.  Especially in these uncertain times American should put travelers safety ahead of profit, how disappointing that the opposite happened on my flight.  As a frequent flyer I’ve accepted that the days of inflight service, crew friendliness, and space on coach are long gone. While in the midst of a pandemic American Airlines took me from point A to point B, 45 minutes ahead of schedule and safely, I got a small bottle of water, a mini pretzel bag, one hand sanitizer wipe and a whole lot of legroom on seat 23F. (See pic below) Great seat in that A321 seat configuration, I highly recommend spending the money for it, there’s no one in front of you, plenty of legroom, and you don’t feel that cramped in a coach American Airlines cabin. There’s really nothing negative to write, taking into consideration how the industry has been changing and the current state of affairs of the travel industry. Good job, I’ll fly again for sure on AA.   Terrible experience. 3/4 of my American flights were delayed causing me to almost miss connections. The biggest kick was last leg home DFW to ANC, plane had no hot water in forward galley, that\\'s not a reason to refuse a plane since 99% of water used comes out of a plastic bottle. You want hot water you\\'ve got a microwave to make that happen. So that delayed us, 3 hours had to swap gates and planes - very frustrating. It was a $500 price difference between Delta and American for my trip. I\\'ll be paying the extra next time for sure! You can\\'t put a price on the extra stress added by late flights and added stress trying to get where you\\'re going on a supposed to be relaxing vacation!   This is ridiculous, I get a round trip ticket from Tul to Dallas to Bakersfield. I was supposed to leave Dallas at 10:30 pm then we get a delay that’s fine stuff happens sometimes, but every time i’d check on the flight the continue to delay the flight. 2 am comes along and we got a plane but we don’t have a pilot, so they decided to cancel the flight. I stay the night in the terrible seats expecting to leave at 10:30 am, but they continued to delay the flight and change the gates repeatedly. Every time I asked for help or for an update on what’s going on they don’t give me an actual answer. I don’t recommend taking their flights if they are gonna treat their customers like that.   I have booked with American several times and they have cancelled my flight literally 5-6 times in 2 weeks. I am still trying to get out! I call and talk to a manager and the manager assures me this time that my seat was secure and I would get out this time only to be cancelled again. I’m suppose to fly out tomorrow. I understand things happen but this is getting out of hand. I wouldn’t be so annoyed if they would at least give me my money back so I could fly with someone else.   American Airlines is the worst company I personally have ever dealt with. Flight on Sunday cancelled, given two options Saturday morning or Monday morning. Chose Saturday morning, get yo airport at 4:00 am with my wife and two small children only to be told we aren’t booked in the Saturday flight, even though we had confirmed. This entire time we are having to change hotel reservations and travel accommodations. Finally flew to destination on Monday, return home yesterday June 25th only to find out our luggage didn’t make the trip.  Overall, four very disappointing flights with American Airlines in First Class. We few MIA -LAX-HNL-LAX-MIA. All were disappointing. Our biggest complaint were the so called First Class seats, frankly I have sat in better and more comfortable seats on an economy flight in Asia. Little legroom, no footrest and a very minimal recline. I am 6\\' 4 \\' and it was impossible to get comfortable and certainly not possible to sleep. We were not allowed to use any lounge despite being in First Class for all legs unless we paid $59.00 for a day pass. The lounges were nothing special and in LAX the ground personnel took pleasure in telling us that the showers were not available to passengers. Boarding all airports was a joke. When the flights are called all passengers surge forward and all the ground staff do is just accept the boarding passes, no control or finesse whatsoever. On board meals were so, so. Nothing exciting and certainly not served with any enthusiasm or pleasure. Only one round of drinks offered on a five hour flight, fortunately we had taken our own water on board. I would urge any future potential American passenger to be very careful and check what type of aircraft will be used, the A321 is a nice aircraft but the AA First Class cabin should be avoided, its just not worth the money. We will not fly American again. Overall an awful experience.   Multiple trips with AA, all of them garbage. Delays with no warning or explanation, blatant disregard for weather advisories, last-minute cancellations with no hope of rebooking, and \"it\\'s not the airline\\'s fault, so we\\'re not gonna give you lodging, or even a place to sit for that matter.\" Every single time something goes wrong, and we\\'re left stranded at a connecting airport for hours with no explanation or concern on their part.  Appleton to Boston. Not my first bad experience with American but my last. Cutting up Advantage credit card - free miles do no good when flight times are changed for no good reason. Seriously, no good reason and causes big layovers. Tickets booked in advance then changed, gate changes - a lot of them. Numerous times arrive on my time then sitting waiting to get gate and unload. Today sitting for an hour after boarding for \"minor\" radio issue - can\\'t even provide free WI-FI with Advantage membership - goodbye and good riddance.  Minneapolis to St. Croix via Miami. The seating situation with American needs to be figured out. American now requires you to pay for most seats if you wish to select them in advance. We spent $2300 on three tickets, and our daughter is a minor. Because we are on a budget with travel, spending an extra $100-$125 out of pocket to select seats isn\\'t realistic for us AND many other people! Like others have complained, our daughter ended up in a seat by herself on multiple occasions. When I asked the staff about it - I was told \"all seats are booked.\" There needs to be an option for families to sit together without having to pay more money for seats - and this is especially true for arranging seats with children. In fact, at the airport, another family approached the desk with the same issue - a parent being separated from their child. We don\\'t expect special treatment, we want to be able to sit next to our child on the airplane! Whatever system American uses to plug people into seats is completely insufficient. In fact, it\\'s ILLEGAL for airlines to not seat a child next to a family member together without charging extra (law passed in 2016).  Why is it every time I fly with American the service in some way is always screwed up. Great flight today from CLT to Seattle and I’m have been on the tarmac for 30 minutes waiting on a gate! What the hell is wrong with you people? At least try and get it right once in awhile!   This aircraft was not clean. According to the clean standards video all high touch areas would be wiped down prior to customer boarding,  however when I took my tray down there were clear crumbs  on the tray table. The floor was disgusting in my row and I didn\\'t want to place my personal bag on the floor. When flying 5 hours or more it was disappointing to be on an aircraft that left me feeling disgusting.   Flight from Miami to Boston at the end of January did anyone else test positive for COVID? I am ashamed of this airline, I will never fly with them again. Absolutely no social distancing on this flight. Every single seat was taken, I am disgusted. Not to mention our flight was delayed yet again due to the plane being unfit to fly seeing that this is a trend with this airline inconveniencing every single person on this flight. Disgrace. Never again. Will never fly this airline again.   We were traveling to Belize for Vacation and were at the airport 3 1/2 hours before our flight but the airport was packed with travelers, we stood in line after finally finding where international began. As the time got closer to our flight we kept stopping Airport employees that were pulling people out to get them checked in in time that had flights to the Dominican Republic and explained we were going to miss our flight and we heard multiple times no you will be fine. Well we weren’t, we were 15 minutes late to the window and were told it was less than a hour before flight. We tried to change to a later flight that day, no help there. Then we finally booked another flight on American to Cancun that we paid for separate from the flights to Belize because we wanted/ needed a vacation and there were no other flights to Belize until 2 days later and we were told we might not get on those. So we have called American Airlines, emailed American Airlines requesting a refund since it was not our fault we missed the flight it was the debacle we experienced at the airport that day with the Airline. We have been told several times we would get a refund then would not receive, then told again if you have to do this to get a refund.. still no refund. All of this is included in the notes American Airlines has on our account, this was back in June 2021 this process started still we get emails saying we can’t get a refund due to the type of ticket we had but it was not our fault for missing flight. I will Never fly American again my husband currently does not fly with them after this incident and he flies weekly for work all over the nation.   The only thing dependable about AA is that they never fail to disappoint you. I had a nice time with very professional, gracious, & courteous agents in the Flagship Lounge. As soon as I joined the Priority boarding line an agent began to bark at me about the coca-cola I had brought from the lounge (even in First Class you\\'ll sit in your seat for an hour before being offered something to drink so I brought one with me). Apparently, as explained by a less abrasive agent, if there is no lid on your soda the agents will assume without reason that you have alcohol in it and so cannot bring it with you. I fail to understand how a lid over a cup will neutralise any alcohol inside if there were any, just as I will never understand the discourtesy and cloddishness of American Airlines\\' ground crew. There must be a professional way to address this issue without embarassing a retired 60-year old schoolteacher in front of the entire boarding lounge. Think about it, AA, isn\\'t there a better way? I\\'ve read they are suspending alcohol sales onboard because of disruptive behaviour from the passengers. It is my judgment that the passengers have not arrive at the airport in such hostile mood until they encounter this airline\\'s staff of jobsworths.  Venice to Phoenix via Philadelphia. American Airlines was a nightmare. As we landed in Philadelphia, our flight to Phoenix was cancelled. We stood in line for hours to re-check in our luggage after custom and to find out if there were other flights. We were treated by the American Airlines staff as packages. The lady that did my check in in Philadelphia had me pay again my extra bag saying that it was overweight. I had already paid the extra bag in Venice. She told me that I was lucky she did not charge me more. My son said that a bag doesn’t just gain weight on a flight, and it all seemed very suspicious. She told him that she did not talk to children. My son is 18 and in college. Her attitude was horrible. I ended up having to pay another $100. She disrespected me and many other passengers. We were placed on a flight for Las Vegas, but after 2 hours on the plane, they had us all get off the plane. The reason: crowded air traffic and no pilots available. We had to wait 3 hours in a long line to find out what was next. Midnight approached. Only 3 people were working with hundreds of passengers in line. Some had small children. One had a very tiny baby. Some had pets. Some were elderly people who were struggling and tired. Some did not speak English and did not understand what was happening. All while one of their staff members was laughing out loud while telling us that none of us was gonna get on any flight until Friday. Her attitude was inhuman. Passengers pay her pay check, and she was treating them like garbage, laughing at them. People were crying and in emotional distress. It was heart breaking. Around 1:00 am, we finally got boarding passes for other flights. However, we had to pay our own Uber and hotel because the flights were the day after and no vouchers were given to us. At 1:30 am, the American Airlines staff stopped serving those passengers that were left in the long line and shut down the assistance. Those people were left hanging until the day after. Some won’t reach their destinations until Saturday night. This is unacceptable. My son and I got extremely sick. I won’t go into detail, but all of this affected other plans and a work trip I had coming up on Sunday. Can’t travel if you are sick, and American Airlines is responsible for every bit of it. I am home and resting now. My thoughts go to those who were left hanging and are yet not at home. I travelled a lot in my life, and this company gave me the worst experience ever. I will never again fly with this company. I should receive a refund for paying again the extra bag twice, the hotel, the Uber, the doctor’s bill, and the emotional distress.  Bought 2 tickets at once so you would think the seats would be together right? Wrong, I could have a better seat on Spirit or Frontier for 92 dollars and saved 300 dollars. The gate lady that the flight attendant called on plane to talk to me was rude and had a attitude and didn’t even answer my question she walked away saying have a nice day. What if one of the tickets I bought was for a kid? Are you going to separate a mother and child? Really stupid to me. Just goes to show just cause it cost more doesn’t mean it’s better. I was offered to come off plane and catch another flight. No I don’t want another flight, I want the flight I paid for and not be in seat provided.   Worst airline anyone could fly. I’d fly a plane on my own before i fly with these people again. Customer service is garbage.   My husband and I tried to checkin online. We were unable to because American Airlines said we had to use VeriFLY. That cost $15. Otherwise we would need to go to the ticket counter at the airport. Please understand we have already paid for TSA and GloBal Entry. While we paid the additional $15 for VeriFLY and did not have to use the downstairs ticket counter at the Philadelphia Airport, we did need Togo to the upstairs ticket counter at our gate to obtain a paper ticket prior to boarding. They are doing whatever they need to do to rip off the customer, while making their life easier. It’s all a scam to collect as much money as possible from their customers.   This is 1 of too many times I have flown American Airlines. Tonight, my flight is delayed, due to weather. That is understandable. What is not understandable is that as all of these people are sitting here, 2 hours after we were supposed to leave - not one single, solitary American Airlines worker at this gate C8 for flight 4362 has made 1 single announcement to give an update. This is ridiculous! The last time I flew with American Airlines in March, we had the rudest flight attendant I have encountered.   I had 2 layovers, one of which required me to sleep in an airport. Fine, I booked that, not complaining about that. But my second layover was a flight from Phoenix to Dallas, then Dallas to Oaxaca. They gave me 30 minutes to deplane In Dallas and get to my flight to Oaxaca, which required taking a train to a different terminal. When I asked them the night before at the kiosk during my previous overnight layover if I could get on an earlier to Dallas, they said no. The only reason I made my connecting flight is because we landed 15 minutes early. When booking my flight, I had no option but this layover. Also despite this, the crew didn’t even let people who had short layovers leave first, and there were at least 3 other people sitting around me who had one hour or less like me. My flight was literally boarding as we landed. As a result some other passenger actually blockaded me in and yelled at me because I was trying to deplane before him. None of that would’ve happened if AA had been more proactive or had any sort of forethought about the situation. Actual flight itself was fine, staff is friendly, but truly this layover experience and getting abused by another passenger as a result of it is going to make me avoid AA at all costs.   This is my 2nd trip on American. Both trips have experienced flight delays. The first time I missed my ride home from the airport, which I\\'d already paid for (Greyhound), so I had to pay another $100 for an Uber. 2 years later, and on my current trip the first flight was delayed for an hour, meaning I would miss my connection. The agent put me on standby for another flight, which ended up being full so I got bumped. They put me on standby again and won\\'t guarantee I\\'ll get on the next flight. I would say I\\'ll never fly American again, but I might not have a choice because I only have a small regional airport near home (if you consider an hour drive \"close\"). The only airline I\\'ve had more problems with was Spirit, and Spirit sets the bar really low.   Flt attendants (DC based) were not professional. After 3 announcements about facial masks being worn, a fellow passenger was seating, usual stuff to arrange bags and seat belts etc. He had to remove his mask momentarily due to the space and cargo he was carrying the and the flight attendant jumped in his face asking why he wasn\\'t wearing a mask. He described to her the issue but she was not having any of it. He explained he had to remove it but was putting it back on. Maybe it was off for 10 seconds. He asked her if these was a problem? Well that was it, she ran to the pilot and told him about an unruly passenger. I have never seen such a display of unprofessionalism in my 35 years of travel. Of course this caused a delay to the flight and many people missed their connections in DFW. I have never ever seen such a display of overreach of power. I was tempted on exiting the plane myself just because of the shear rudeness.   I checked in through the kiosk and paid my $30 fee for my luggage and when I looked at my credit card the next day I got charged $30 plus a $32 fee so I thought that was weird, I called American Airlines and they said it was a priority fee so I can board the plane first but to me that was weird because I never got asked that and plus I had an infant and it never even popped up on the kiosk, it said the total charge would be $30 and that $32 fee is non-refundable. I\\'ve caught on that\\'s a scam they\\'re doing to try to get extra money from people so please beware don\\'t fly American Airlines, you\\'re better off going with Southwest.   Haven’t actually taken flight yet. Flight was delayed by 3 days. They tried to reschedule flight to London with an 8 hour layover from 12am to 8am 3 days after original flight date, then after lots of work, we got a direct flight to Chicago 3 days after as well. Their service is awful. They are extremely unhelpful with information. We didn’t even get real seats on the plane. They told us we need to figure it out when we check in. They shouldn’t be overbooking flights or canceling flights without any notice. We had to wake up early to come today and we only found out our flight was canceled upon arrival. The last plane was extremely uncomfortable. There was even less leg room than I remember. I couldn’t even reach my bag under the seat in front of me because I couldn’t bend down. I am quite thin (size 2 and like 110 pounds) and I felt cramped. Image the average sized American trying to fly economy somewhat comfortably. The sets in front of me was also in my lap basically so I couldn’t even use my computer with the tray due to that. The food was awful. Some of it was still frozen and the “hot” food was Luke warm at best. Definitely my worst travel experience with this airline and I wouldn’t recommend it. Poor management and organization, little comfort in economy class, and an overall stressful experience.   Literally the worst airline to fly with. Even frontier is better than them at this rate. The flight was packed full during the current pandemic while everyone else in the country is forced to follow strict COVID 19 guidelines. It’s insane how airlines like American get away with squeezing everyone in with zero consequences. Not to mention the flight attendant told a passenger that they needed the spaces seating (unlike the paying passengers) in case one of the attendants “got COVID” within the 3 hour long flight. Mind blowing.   Miami to London. I do not normally post reviews however after this experience I felt that I was obliged to do so as the experience was so poor. Both the service and the food on AA has sunk to an all time low, it is amazing that on both legs of this trip hardly any of the cabin crew could even manage a smile, the uniform seems to be a thing of the past with one male cabin crew wearing black shoes with white soles and one female wearing a black and white patterned blouse, none of them appeared to want to be there. I was in the mini cabin of the 777-300 in Business and when I received no wine or bread with the meal I went up to the cabin crew and informed them, when someone did come down she said to me \\'you know what we call you people here\\' \\'The forgotten ones\\' Having alerted the crew to this issue, I was however looked after very well for the rest of the flight by a very pleasant senior member of the cabin crew. The food is simply diabolical, the starter was a plate of bland inedible leaves, the steak was tough and tasteless, as was the chicken breast on the return flight, the vegetables hard and bland and it reminded me somewhat of school dinners from the past. The thing you notice most is the \\'greyness\\' of the meal, just plain and boring, with no flair or care taken. The only plus point is the Häagen-Dazs ice cream, which they can\\'t mess up. Safety is supposed to be a priority in the air, however the plane took off and landed with most of the blinds closed in First and Business, people were still asleep lying down on the final approach to landing and would have still been asleep had they not awoken on their own and most of the blinds remained down for landing. I was actually on a previous AA flight (EZE - MIA) where 2 Flagship Suites still had sleeping passengers in them on landing. Whoever is in charge of AA cabin crew has evidently \\'dropped the ball\\' or is not aware what is going on, there is obviously no in flight appraisals or monitoring of cabin crew or their performance. All I can hope is that the aircraft maintenance division do not work to the same level of proficiency and professionalism as the cabin crew. The only singular plus point that I have for AA is the Flagship Suite which is both comfortable, versatile and private. Despite the failings of the current (not new) Club World seat that British Airways is offering, both cabin service and meal offerings are streets ahead of AA and are created with a true desire to offer contemporary and tasty food and I would not choose AA again after this experience. Someone in AA who is responsible for both cabin crew and food need to actually travel, unannounced and actually see for themselves what is happening, maybe the company is just too big and there are no real controls, or the people responsible for certain areas of the business are not doing their jobs and do not have to answer for their performance, I can see no other reason for such a dismal offering in a competitive environment. I would like to see the meals that I was served brought to the CEO of AA and presented to him in the way they were presented to me and see him actually eat them, I think he would be appalled by it and maybe then something would change and a branch and root examination of the food offering would be carried out. This review may seem harsh in places, but I was so shocked by how poor the experience was that I felt I just had to say something.   We had a great flight. I just wanted to give a shout out to Rlsa and Dana. We were in flight 319 from Dallas, Texas to Punta Cana on April 3, 2021. They were terrific. Very welcoming and made our trip so comfortable and enjoyable. I so hope we get them on the way back home on April 10, 2021. We have always had nice flights with American but they went out of their way and always had a smile on their face.  I paid extra for window seat since I’m claustrophobic. They gave me a seat next to a wall. I had a panic attack and they wouldn’t even bring me water. The flight attendant made me wait until she had her cart up front to start serving water. The absolute worst airline I’ve ever flown.   Horrible experience. We\\'ve been stuck at the airport for 3 days. They kept delaying, then canceling, taking us to the hotel for three days, playing games with us. Once they board us to the plane and de boarded us again. Staff rude and aggressive. My husbands mask moved little bit down during the second day de boarding and flight attendant screamed at him and then to the pilot \"he doesn\\'t have a mask! \" when he had. We finally spend another thousand of dollars and took another airline, Frontier after three days of AA games and got home safe. Never fly AA!   Dallas to Ontario. Rude attendants that lie, poor customer service and poor planes. Worst few flights I’ve been on. Extremely disappointed, fly with anyone else if you can   Very unprofessional! I landed two days ago and I am yet to have my luggage! Also lost my luggage on the way to Saint Lucia! Customer service was not helpful whatsoever and very rude. I’d rather pay a higher price at another airline then to take American Airlines ever again.   Worst airline I have ever flown with. Would not recommend anyone to fly with American Airlines. Our flight has been delayed 3 times and when we finally boarded 24 hours after our original flight they made us get off the plane as one of the crew members was on a different flight that hasn’t even arrived yet and we got delayed by another 2 hours. Also the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. Will never fly with American Airlines again.   Five separate employees (two flight attendants and three staff at gates) provided with me the worst and most blatantly bad service I\\'ve experienced during decades of flying. The complete lack of concern, the rudeness and arrogance (reaching absurd levels of contempt) the shockingly uncaring employees have clinched my decision to eliminate this once great airline from any future travel plans. I want to warn you that this traveler was surprised and saddened by this past week\\'s attempt at travel from JFK to Tucson via Phoenix on this airline. My conclusion is that the new marketing campaign for this huge airline must be centered around this core value: \"blank Airlines: You Mean Nothing To Us.\"   I booked my seat for these flights 5 months in advance. I was told I was being moved to coach for the long flight between Philadelphia and Seattle minutes before the flight was due to board. I was told I would not have my money returned to me and instead be provided with a voucher for future travel, which I don\\'t need and wouldn\\'t use. The reason provided was that the computer randomly selects four passengers to reseat in order to comply with weight distribution requirements. Upon further investigation, I discovered this was a lie and the airline had overbooked the aircraft. Although ultimately I did have my seat remain in first class, I was surrounded by people who had booked their first class seats within days of the flight. If the weight really needed to be leveled out in the plane, why weren\\'t passengers being asked to move who had booked their travel more recently? I had booked these seats for medical reasons and as I explained that to the manager on duty at the gate in Philadelphia, it didn\\'t seem to matter. The airline also charged me for first class for my flight from Albany to Philadelphia while I was stuffed into a regular seat at the front of the small plane that didn\\'t differ from any of the other seats. Food is also not provided for short flights even though I was in first class. The flight from Philadelphia to Seattle was grounded for 2.5 hours before take off due to a sensor issue with the lavatory sensor. No compensation was offered to the passengers of the plane for this major inconvenience. On my return trip I had a layover at Chicago International and my connection flight got moved to the opposite side of the Airport at the last minute and my wheel chair assistance was late and I almost missed my connection flight back to Albany. Overall, I felt undervalued as a consumer of American Airlines. I do not feel they give proper treatment to passengers with disabilities.   I have a couple of major issues with AA after today’s flights. Firstly, carry on. My assigned grouping prevented me from boarding until 90% of passengers were already on the plane. When I could finally board, AA staff told that there was no space in the cabin for any more carry on items and that my single item (which met their carry on requirements) would have to be checked in. I replied that this was the first leg of a long journey to Australia and I needed access to my carry on. They literally said there was nothing they could do about that and that I would be bumped from the flight if I refused to check it in. They also said the door was closing soon so I had to decide immediately. I feel that this created an element of duress that was at a minimum unethical. I also think that their attitude to customers is appalling considering that these situation are 100% AA’s fault - their carry on requirements don’t align with the capacity of their own aircraft. When I finally received my suitcase back from them in Sydney, I found that they had somehow completely destroyed it (see attached photo). Secondly, the flight took off from DC at 5:15pm and landed in LA at 11pm (DC time). Who wouldn’t want to eat dinner at some point during these hours? Nevertheless, the only food they offered was a small packet of either cookies (for other Australians, this translates to “2 small biscuits) or pretzels. I couldn’t even pay them for real food - they just had nothing. I wouldn’t treat a dog like AA treats their customers.   Flight from Holguin-Cuba to Miami on May 5th scheduled for departure at 1:30pm. (AA 2726) I got to the check-in station at 11:35pm with only a carry-on and there was nobody there. I was told by the front desk lady that the fight was already closed and I had lost the flight. She sent me to the American Airlines office at the airport. At the office, the AA representative told me that \"the plane was already closed because passengers have to be at the check in point 3hrs before departure\". I was about one and a half hours talking to these AA reps at the airport while the plane was still there and they didn\\'t want to check me in. Same thing happened to more than 10 passengers. This is just insane. Happen that the Cuban dictatorship have a charter plane for this same itinerary scheduled for departure three hours and a half later, and they offer you to buy a ticket for this second plane as an alternative for you to fly on the same day. My wife and myself had to buy this other flight ticket for $518.00 in order to get home that last night. I just called customer service on May 6th at at 4:00pm and the representative told me that he doesn\\'t know what happened, but he recommends to be at the check-in point 3hrs before the flight. I requested to talk to a supervisor and the supervisor told me that I am supposed to be 2hrs sharp before the flight at the check-in point and I have to file the complaint online instead to talk to customer service. They will only give credit to fly again only from Cuba. Very disappointing.  I have to say, I really regret ever trying to fly with American Airlines. Most airlines will give you a credit of some sort when you’re unable to make your flight, But not American Airlines. Back in November of 2022 I bought a ticket for my my wife to fly out to Honolulu this February of 2023. We bought her ticket well in advanced. And unfortunately the flu hit our family. And my wife is in able to travel due to having a high fever. American Airlines refused to give us any kind of credit and said that only those people with a positive Covid test will get sickness credits. Absolutely ridiculous. American Airlines wouldn’t work with us in any way so we had to eat the $500 for the plane ticket. I’m very sad for my wife and I’m even more disappointed in the quality of customer care American Airlines provides.   Today our flight was delayed 5 hours (with less than 30 mins notice from our boarding time). We missed our connecting flight. Our entire trip is delayed 24 hours and we lose a whole day. Had they notified us sooner we could have rearranged things and saved a day. The last time I flew with American they cancelled my flight last minute. Sent me to two different connecting flights with barely enough time to make it. Told me they would pay for my hotel for the evening but never did. Another time they not only delayed our flights home and added a day to the trip but also lost our luggage. This airline is absolute trash. Never again will I fly with American.  San Diego to Charlotte. Never ever flying with American Airlines again! First our gates were changed 3 times before our flight and was circling around the airport for half an hour. After boarding on the plane all passengers were forced to wait over a hour due to “a maintenance problem” just to find out they wanted to turn the whole plane around just to let more passengers on the flight. After getting off the plane I found out my baggage never made it on my flight and they tried to blame it on the rain and say it got lost and didn\\'t get my luggage three days later. This airline is very unprofessional and this is why American is cheap. I do not recommend flying with American.  Honolulu to Los Angles via Tampa. Don\\'t waste your money. If you are not on a flight of more than 5 hours, you get no comfort. Yes, bigger seats but no premium class like the 787-9 Dreamliner that we actually flew on once we left Tampa and got into Dallas/Fort Worth. But you still paying the higher price. Each flight\\'s aircrew standards were different as were each airport and each Admiral Club and Flagship Lounge. If you\\'re an occasional flyer and want to waste your money, go right ahead. No standardization in any employee at any aircrew or airport. Very poor, not recommended.   Good service generally but three major complaints. Because Limited business class space, had to fly economy. After two legs in business class (Johannesburg, Dubai, Miami) this represented huge challenges with luggage, which cost a fortune. Did nobody foresee this disconnect? Loyalty program is a total con - none of benefits (priority boarding, first bag free) materialized. So why bother? Blatant profiling at boarding, clearly rules apply only to certain passengers   I asked AA to change my flight or provide a credit for an honest mistake in my purchase. I accidentally picked the wrong cities to leave and go to backwards. They refused to give a credit or help me change it unless I paid an additional $500 dollars for one way! I will never fly AA again. My return flight was through United and they immediately cancelled the flight and gave me a future credit. No one could do anything nor did they care that I was out money and the flight is wasted.   The worst airline to deal with customer service. I got to the airport 2hrs before my flight. No one figured out how to pay the taxes on a flight bought with points. I used the wrong card at booking. So I had to pay the taxes. After waiting 30 min in the customer service line I was told I had to call American Airlines. But I was at the customer service counter. So I called them. And after waiting another 45 min I was told that I had to deal with the customer service at the airport. I had to ask for a manger just to find out what I needed to do. They just keep telling me I had to buy another flight if I wanted to deal with them at the counter. No one seemed to figure out wat I needed to do. Which cost me losing the bag drop off time. American Airlines can keep their points and services away from me. I would never spend 1$ with them again.  La Guardia to Toronto. I purchased a Ticket from American Airlines for a round-trip to Toronto to attend a wedding. The event was cancelled due to the COVID Restrictions; I received an Airline Credit from the Airline that is due to expire on 31 March 2022. I no longer have a reason to fly to Toronto (wedding was cancelled!) so I requested a refund, or the opportunity to fly to another location. AA tells me that I must fly the original route, before the end of March or lose my money. So I\\'ve lost the funds for that Trip that was impacted by COVID, and AA will not provide me with a refund allow me to use the money I\\'ve already paid. Recommend everyone be extremely careful before booking with AA, I will not use this Airline again.   Connection flight was cancelled. Instead I got two extra flights. One of which was delayed, and the other was postponed by two days. Two nights at the hotel were unpaid and no food was provided.   Miami to La Guardia. Worst experience ever. My baggage has been lost and no one is taking responsibility.No one knows what there job is it’s all about money they dont care for your security or luggage highly not recommended.   My special needs disabled daughter was flying special services escort and UM, and was abandoned at a gate in Chicago O’Hare airport. This airline was horrible people with special needs and parents letting their kids fly unattended please avoid them, they do not care about your loved ones.   Total disrespect from staff at B7 around 11:45 p.m. July 2, 2023, who requires additional training on how to handle customers who are frustrated due to delayed flights (we were respectful and desired the same toward us) even customers that\\'s upset and not respectful as a customer service rep no one/she don\\'t / did not have the right to be disrespectful, get smart/sarcastic. We just wanted an additional room and I knew it was possible, as much money as American Airlines make. She also said due to our reservations was made together, this was the reason we were given only 1 room. She needs additional training or termination if this is repeated actions of hers which should not be tolerated in her field of service! AA did at least, after we were assisted by a nice manager named Liz and another gentleman that was with her, we did eventually received free taxi/ shuttle service to a nice Hilton Garden Inn facility, 2 nice clean rooms, a meal ticket (of only $12, but still was nice to receive) and we also was booked on another flight the next morning.   I do not recommend this airline. We were supposed to travel to Mexico on a Basic Economy fare, as a family of 5. Unfortunately, we all contracted covid and couldn’t go. We received and submitted medical notes and we were told non refundable. Our return flight was with a different airline (jetblue) and we received that refund. Very unhappy as we have used American Airlines for all our traveling.   Flew to DFW from Vancouver one way after attending a wedding. No delays on inbound flight. The flight was smooth with very little turbulence encountered. Kudos to American Airlines flight crew. They were polite and friendly. Premium Economy seat had enough legroom for a comfortable flight. Service is typical (biscotti, snack and soft drinks) of all domestic flights. American does a pretty good job of getting you were you want on their domestic and trans border flights.   I am very disappointed on how American Airlines is running their business during this pandemic. They have shown they only care about the bottom line money. We were on a very crowded plane and felt unsafe. They filled every seat. Who\\'s to know where the person next to me was before he got on? I had flown that same week on Southwest and had such a different experience. They made sure each middle seat wasn\\'t taken. Made me feel a bit safer. American Airlines has always been more expensive. Which is fine but I thought with the type of money they charge they would be a bit more careful. Would I recommend this airline? The answer has to be no, not at this time.(not during the pandemic)   They cancelled our outbound flight and wouldn\\'t give us a refund so we had to buy another ticket through Delta. On our way home our flight got delayed two times, so we missed our connecting flight and stood in the American Airlines line for FIVE HOURS for them to tell us they cant do anything and wouldnt even give us a hotel so we had to sleep in the airport. Finally got a new flight the next day which was also delayed two times (sat on the air plane for two hours) and they lost our bags and that flight was also very hot. Never flying them again, ruined our whole trip.   Worst Airline in the world. I am from Texas, my daughter goes to college on the East Coast, she’s been flying on American Airlines from Texas quite a few times and always the flight is delayed somehow. So now we thought they cleaned up their act, today she was traveling from Houston to New Jersey and her flight got delayed from Houston 1 hour for no reason, so she missed the scheduled flight from Dallas to New Jersey. So she got reservation for the 5.00 pm flight and she checked in now they’re saying an hour delayed. Now they’re saying it’s delayed till 6.45 pm don’t think they ever fly on time at all. Don’t fly American, they delay the flight for no reason.  \\r\\nI live in CT, and tried to take a trip to NC because I had an important appointment made over a month in advance, that cost $175 to make. My flight was scheduled for July 11th with 1 stop. Well, at midnight July 11th, hours before my flight, I was notified my flight got cancelled. Called American Airlines to find it took from midnight to 8pm to get off hold. Literally 20 hours on hold. The person told me that they had no flights going out the 11th, and that the next flight was on the 12th. Great, just missed the appt I waited a month and paid for. Now my entire trip has no value or meaning. Well, I paid for 4 Choice Window seats so that I get the seats I want, and guess what? That $35 per seat isn\\'t refunded or transferred to the new plane. They just decided I don\\'t get to choose my seats anymore despite paying for them. First flight went down, landed in WA, then of course the 2nd flight was delayed 3 and a half hours. Got to NC over a day late, tired and didn\\'t even have a reason to be there anymore. Whatever. So, my return was scheduled on July 16th with one stop in Philly. Of course, I drive 2 hours from Murphy NC to Ashville for the airport, and in the parking lot I get a text saying they cancelled my flight to Philly, but not the one to CT. Wow. So their plan was to fly me to Philadelphia, leave me there, and not even take me to CT. Call them again and wait 7 hours for them to get off hold, and they tell me there\\'s no flights to CT until the 18th. I looked and found Southwest and Delta Air Lines were both flying from NC to CT with no issue, and was told that only American Airlines cancelled. Are you kidding me? So, they rescheduled my flight for the 18th, and I had to pay for a hotel for 2 days in NC as well as tell my boss at work that American Airlines abandoned me halfway across the country and refused to take me home. He wasn\\'t happy. I also had to call my grandfather and tell him for the next two days, I\\'d need him to drive an hour to my house to care for my animals. Great. The return flight finally comes, and I don\\'t have my choice seating that I paid for because once again the flight I paid money for never took off. Well, I sit down in my assigned seat that has 0 leg room and is insanely uncomfortable (the planes were literally so small there was only 3 seats per row and you had to duck not to hit your head, worst flights in history) and what do you know? \"Sorry sir but this side of the plane is too heavy we need someone to move.\" Then guess what? \"Were sorry but a component of the plane has broken and we are going to need a new aircraft, please wait as we reboard you.\" Are you actually kidding? I had to stay another 5 hours in the airport waiting for a new plane to come so we could take our flight. I get back to CT 3 days late, to find those extra 3 days also cost me $70 in airport parking. My original flight was $670. I paid $35 x 4 for choice seats. I didn\\'t receive a single one of those seats. I paid to leave on July 11th, I was forced to leave on the 12th. I paid to come back on July 16th, I was forced to come back July 18th. I did a quick online booking, which led to 28 hours on hold on the phone. After contacting American Airlines, they were insanely rude to me, literally would compensate me even for the choice seats I didn\\'t get. No support!  \\r\\nYou know, one wonders how it is even legal that airlines are able to drastically change flight times that take time away from vacations and leave the consumer with little to no choice for pre planned air travel. Our flight to Hawaii has been changed multiple times, each time with less desirable times/earlier departure, later arrivals, to get layover etc. We are currently sitting in Dallas which went from a 2 hour layover to 6 hours, only to become 12 hours! How is this acceptable service? Get it together AA. Some sort of mechanical issue to which the woman announcer says “it is out of our hands” really? I’m pretty sure this entire debacle is in your hands. These airlines need to be held to some sort of standard. It is ridiculous that they can hold us hostage and not hold up their end of a transaction that costs thousands of dollars. We would never have a booked a flight that took two days to get from Hawaii to Detroit. If we did it would have been at a greater discount. In this age of automated, non existent customer service we are left to vent our frustrations wherever we can. Therefore, American Airlines you suck.  We started our day with American Airlines changing our flight four times, just hours before we departed. Our original flight got so delayed that we would’ve been 3 hours late to our connecting fight, so we changed it to an earlier one. Then that got delayed. We spoke to employees, tried to get some advice on what we could do. They said we’d make it, we just had to be fast. We finally got to Phoenix where our connection was, running to the gate full speed to find out that we had missed it by one minute. But that wouldn’t have mattered, because they took us off the flight without telling us, again, so we couldn’t have boarded regardless. They stuck us on a route that connects a total of 3 times with about 18 hours of being stuck in this hell hole, with no compensation whatsoever. We booked our flight months in advance, paid hundreds extra to avoid this exact flight, and they can’t even be bothered to offer us a meal credit let alone any sort of discount or refund. I’ve never been treated with such apathy, the entire airline has no problem changing around your plans for their convenience. There’s absolutely no point in booking a flight with them because you can guarantee it will change a million times and land on a horrible last resort. My partner and I love to travel and I’m never going near an American flight again.   The worst employees and policies of any airline. Over four flights in two weeks I received multiple rebooking, for no reason one woman straight up didn’t let me on the plane and when another employee asked why she walked away. Then a different flight we needed our bags rerouted after American misplaced them and an employee at the help desk pretended and said she couldn’t do anything. I spoke to another employee and he did it in 10 seconds the fact that they allow this is disgusting   Flew with American Airlines to Orlando for a family funeral, flight was cancelled due to hurricane but the airline got me on the next flight, staff and flight was great, meals were good. On return I had to extend my flight date and the airline and customer service were fantastic, very helpful and didn’t even charge me due to family loss. Definitely recommend them for their great service. Thank you to all staff who helped me.  The worst flight experience I\\'ve ever had, waiting nearly 2 hours for the pilot to show up another 2 hours after landing to park the plane. Flight was for 9pm I didn\\'t get off the plane until after 130am. It was a 1 hour flight.  I upgraded my ticket to Business Class to fly the longest leg of my trip (8.5 hours From Buenos Aires to Miami), comfortably. I wanted to be able to sleep throughout the majority of the flight given it was a night flight, I knew I had a 3 hour layover in Miami plus an additional 5 hours to Los Angeles therefore it was needed to rest well. Unfortunately, the seat had a very, very bright light right at the end of the seat (its a flat bed), I tried everything to turn it off, the flight attendant came over and said there was nothing she could do to turn it off, either the lights control panel wasn\\'t working, or there was a missing cover at the end of the seat in front of me. I specifically paid $980 on top of the already paid ticket to be able to have a decent flight, contrary to it I had a brilliant light pointing at my eyes the entire flight, to add salt to the injury the attendant suggested to use the complimentary eye cover to avoid the light, well, I didn\\'t pay close to $1000 for an eye cover. American Airlines should check every seat to make sure all is working properly instead of profiting and not spending money on needed repairs.   The most incompetent people must run this whole thing. I cannot count how many times they changed the terminal I was supposed to be at. And the audacity of one if your workers to yell at me in front of people because she was ignoring me and then I said, \"Excuse me, may I get some help?\" She yelled that she was dealing with another customer, which was a woman in a wheelchair that she was also ignoring. The help on the plane were rude as well and apparently you all love to yell at customers, making a scene and embarrassing us. Get it together!   I had two flights cancelled due to weather. I get that, however there was no help in rebooking my flight. I finally returned home 32 hours later then planned. I missed two days of work (in which I was not paid) and I had to cover the cost of an additional 40 hours to my 86 year old mother\\'s home care. I received no compensation not even airline points. I have been a loyal AA customer as well as a holder of their credit card. There was also an issue in June where my flight was delayed 8 hours and I had to sleep in the Charlotte airport. I am a 58 year old female traveling alone and sleeping in an airport. At least cough up some extra free miles! I\\'m done!!  American Airlines flight 1901 gate F79 TPA to CLT. Flight crew were disrespectful, rude and not concerned with anyone but themselves. Management does not have any responsibility for staff actions and the flight crew is a direct reflection of the pilot. I have never had a drink taken out of my hands by anyone on a flight in my entire life and flying on planes my entire life. Manager says basically not my problem. Choose a different airline!   I will never fly American again. Lady helping with virtual check in asked if I was checking in my carry on and I said no, she persisted to tell me to put it in the blue bin to size it. I said I’ve flown with this before and she said “I’m not asking, I’m telling you”. I was appalled and went straight to check in my bag as I was flying first. Then the slowest service waiting in a queue of three before I was served. Still cannot believe the attitude of the staff.   The departing flight changed by 3.5 hours. I called to ask for a refund and was rejected. A few weeks later the flight home was changed as well, by 2.5 hours. Neither of these worked for us. I called to ask for a refund (not credit) and was told it had to be a 4 hour change. I explained it was a 6 hour change (if you considered both ways). The customer service rep then said \\'yes, the I did qualify for a full refund, since it was over 4 hours\\'. He said he would cancel my flight but I would need to go online to request the refund. I asked \\'what if my refund is denied\\' and he said it would not be because he was putting notes in my file saying he approved the refund. He canceled my flight, I submitted the online request for refund and received an email saying my request was denied. I spent hours and hours trying to get ahold of someone. The only forum is the online system that sends them an email. I explained that a customer service rep told me I would get full refund. They just kept denying my refund. I was finally able to talk to a cust serv rep on the phone to explain situation and she said that there were no notes in my file and I did not qualify for a refund.  I will not fly American anymore. They can make all kinds of changes to flight times and you are at their mercy. And they you cannot trust what you are being told by the customer service reps. This makes me sick to my stomach knowing there is some AA rep out there laughing at me because he just told me what I wanted to hear and he knew he was misinforming me to get me off his back.   I flew from Fort Myers to Bozeman with an 8 hour layover in Dallas while in Dallas they changed my gate 3 times so I had to take a train across the airport twice and had my belongings stolen in the process, when I called American Airlines to change my flight so I didn\\'t have to sit in Dallas for 8 hours again because I didn\\'t feel safe I was told that I had pay an additional $250.00 even though the flight I was trying to change to was less than my original flight. All American Airlines cares about is money, they don\\'t care about people at all. I will never fly American Airlines again   American Airlines advertises travel flexibility all over its website - however this is only if you buy a certain level of ticket. I flew to UK to look after my father in hospice. Obviously I did not know when I would be flying home. Flight Flexibility was key to me. I had to change my flight dates several times, each time paying extra dollars even though airline says no change costs. The extra fees were because tickets were getting more and more expensive. On December 12th I rebooked a flight from Manchester to Seattle to depart December 16th. I was given the same Record Locators, one for BA, operator and one for American, the airline I paid. After talking to American Airlines on December 12th I checked that the flights were correct on American Airlines website under ‘manage my flight’. The reservation was correct. On December 15th I phoned American to get my frequent flier mile number added. That same day at 18:50 I received an e-mail from America saying that my transatlantic flight had been cancelled with no explanation. The reason I am writing this is because when I called American to find another flight they told me that since my December 16th flight was never ticketed they owed me nothing. In order to fly home I would have to spend another $2542 for a one way ticket on top of $1483 I had already spent. There were no coach tickets left because they cancelled their flight and put everybody on BA. American would not take any responsibility for the error of their customer service person who did not issue a ticket for me Dec 12th. There was no way I could know this from looking on the website - I even had seat assignments. American refused to help in other way than sell me a Business Class ticket on BA. How can an error from an American Airlines person be now charged to me?  We had a flight from New Orleans to Los Angeles, landing at around 1pm. The morning of our flight it was cancelled and the only option we had was to book a flight from NOLA to DC with a 4hr layover then a flight from DC to La. Now we are getting home around 9pm with an extra 6/7 hrs of flight time. The lady at the boarding desk was no help, I don\\'t blame her. But I think its so stupid and inconsiderate of American Airlines to delay and change our whole flight schedule and making us fly 11 hours to get back home when it only took us about 4hrs to get here. I understand that things happen, but the best they could have done is at least put us on a flight towards our destination. This is my first flying with them and will be the last.   Did a r/t Philadelphia to Madrid in Oct/Nov 2023 and quite honestly can say it was one of the worst airline trips I have ever experienced and I have travelled extensively around the world in the past 30 years. The cabin crew were unfriendly and downright rude to passengers in economy. The food was terrible and fit only for pigs. Looks like AA cabin crew are coached to treat economy class passengers as 2nd class citizens. The good is that the flights were on time and arrived at destinations safely. Needless to say, avoid AA if you can.   Philadelphia to Jamaica. My husband & I go on a vacation every 6 months. We have been flying American Airlines for about 8 years now. We loved American Airlines for many years however the last 2 years have seen a huge decline in onboard service. I felt it was time to vent! We have been fortunate to be able to fly 1st class on our vacation trips recently & for the price paid the Flight attendants are scarce and robotic. They seem to talk more to their coworkers then passengers. I was very disappointed on our trip last week. The attenders basically “quickly did their job” then mingled with their coworkers till flight was over. Very rude. I actually put my “help light” on to request a simple blanket & no one came to help. If 1st class isn’t getting the service I can’t imagine the service for regular passengers. How disgraceful AA. Maybe you need to start riding your planes ominously to experience the ride.   The rude woman at the front desk got mad at me because I asked to check in some of my luggage early and I did not know that was against the rules. Because I insisted, she got mad and canceled my flight without telling me. So when I go to check in with all of my family, I get the run around, I get ignored, and they had me all through the airport trying to get to this flight that I was never going to get on. Then they tell me that I missedthe flight because I arrived late. I learn later that I was not late, because my flight actually got delayed and I was actually early. But they did not tell me that because I was no longer on that flight(since she had cancelled me off that flight). So they make me think it\\'s my fault that I missed my flight and in reality I miss the fight because she changed my flight. I sat and cried out of anger and humiliation and they did not care. That was their way of reprimanding me and I was never informed of what really happened. Inhumane treatment of fellow human beings.    Had a great flight. American Airlines was the best. Smooth flying. Reasonable fares. Seats were comfortable. Had window seat at wing. The wife and i received a canned drink and cookies 45 mins after take off. Flight slightly less than 2 hours long, 1000 miles. Way better than driving.   Awful experience with American airlines. I had a trip planned to New Orleans with a layover both ways. The fight leg of the trip we got rerouted to Washington and should have gone to Charlotte. This flight should have left at 7:30 am but we didn\\'t take off till 2:30. Customer in the airport was lacking. We asked for help to find a different flight and or status of the current flight and we told its not my fault the plane we are waiting for had mechanical issues. Not so much as a apologize or a sense of compassion about the situation. The plane finally came and the previous passenger got off the plane and we boarded with in 10 minutes. This tells me the plane was not cleaned even though there are signs in the gate area posted by American airline on how their passenger safe is important and they keep with the highest standards of sterilizing. That\\'s a joke. There idea of sterilizing is handing the boarding passages and alcohol wipe as they got on the plane but yet I\\'m still required to wear a mask that I can take off to eat or drink and expose myself and other to sickness from touching something on their dirty plane. Leaving New Orleans our plane boarded 45 mins late and there was no communication from American airline at all and the same cleaning issue occurred. Thanks for the alcohol wipe American airlines. We were also layer over on the way home. Our flight out of Charlotte also left late and still no cleaning procedures in ace but the small 2x2 alcohol wipe provides. I called the customer service number and schedule a call back since hold times were over 4 hours (I kid you not) One I finally got someone on the phone I was told I have to reach out to customer relations to file a complaint. I was directed to the aa.com website. Here guess what you only get to send an email and are limited to the number of characters you can enter regarding your complaint. So let me get this straight American airlines you are available to talk to customers when you are scheduling flights (or taking money) but when you have gotten paid for a service regardless of the quality of this service the you claim to care so much about or at least that is what you on hold recording says you are no longer available to help. I work in customer service and this is unexpected treatment of your customers. Never again will I give my money to American Airlines and I will make sure I tell others.   AA is quite possibly the worst airline operating. I never fly anything but Delta: I should have known better. This trip was random and the price seemed right for a first class ticket, given the time of year and time between when I booked it and the trip date. I was bumped from first class on my connecting flight because it was \"full.\" Because I was bumped to coach, I was given a trip credit of $300. Upon calling and trying to get that amount refunded to my card, I was told that there was no way I could get that money back and I could only use it for future flights. Even when I explained I would not be flying AA again, I was denied a refund. So, a few months later, I booked a flight for my girlfriend with the intention of only using the trip credit. When I booked the flight using the trip credit #, the price did not reflect any credits. I canceled that flight immediately and rebooked it making sure that the credit was being applied. The website clearly showed me the difference on the screen and even had a message stating that the credit amount would be reflected on my credit card account. Several days later when the charge finally posted to my account, the credit was not reflected at all. After calling and being put on hold for nearly 3 hours total, I was told that the credit was not applied to my purchase and that I could not cancel it because it was over 24hrs and that the only way to use the credit was to book a new flight. There is more, but as it stands now, I will have to book another future flight to use my credit. Again, I never wanted to fly AA again but here we are. I would almost certainly fly Southwest or JetBlue before I ever fly AA again.  Delayed causing me to miss a critical connection flight and completely disrupted travel plans and greatly increased my expenses and duration of the trip. This inconvenience has been extremely costly.   Flight delayed/changed last moment. Confusing gates and times. Helpless staff. Asking passengers to check in Google for gate number. If possible avoid this airline.   I’m sitting here in my middle seat on a flight to NYC on a full plane and I just want to know one thing. What reality do American Airlines live in? Where do they  get off filling a plane completely, observing zero social distancing guidelines and putting every single customer and staff members at greater risk while spouting that “your safety and well-being has always been our highest concern.” I beg you, for the good of all the people who are quite literally putting their lives and future in your hands. Put your overinflated profits and egos aside. This virus is still here. You cannot pretend that it isn’t. Do better.  Appalled! Worst agent at the gate. Grabbed my arm and told me my carry on luggage was not going with me that I had to check it in. Said it did not fit the slot to see if it fits. It fit and she told me no! I told her I have flown this airline before and she told me the overhead bins were different. Very disrespectful and unprofessional. When I went in the plane without my luggage the top bins had a lot of room for more luggage. I hope people don’t fly this airline! Very unprofessional.   Guadalajara to Washington Dulles. It was mid morning/day and I bought a fragile small statue of baby Jesus. I had 2 of them. Then when I got back home and I opened the package with bubble wrap it was broken. it’s American’s fault because they probably throw the luggage very hard into the cargo.  I have a baby and we went to the baggage claim and we were waiting and waiting a long time because we got everything except the car seat. So we went to the oversized baggage center and apparently when the car seat came out it was broken. Plus they didn’t put a plastic wrapping on on it. The last time I flew to Phoenix, Arizona I flew with Frontier Airlines and when I went to the baggage claim to pick up my car seat for my baby it did have that plastic wrapping so it could protect it.  This is the worst airline ever. I have flown 2 times in the last 6 months with them both having connecting flights and all were horrible! Family of 8 stuck on plane for 2 1/2 hours in PV no air conditioning for maintenance issue. Recent flight was diverted to Luckenbach because of fuel issue then sat for 3 hours there and pilots timed out! No water in bathroom to wash hands and toilet wouldn\\'t flush! Finally got to Dallas and connector to Detroit canceled and was told nothing for 3 days! No food for everything was closed, all hotels full so had to sleep in chair at airport! Spirit Airlines has moved way above American airlines in my book!  The first leg of our returning from Barcelona, Spain was to stop in JFK, New York. This was the most pleasant flight we have had. Kudos to 2 flight staff for an excellent service. Their professionalism is second to none. American Airline is well-served by staff like them. Unfortunately, the second leg of our trip from JFK to LAX was at most a wee-bit less than fair. The airplane is an old one with compact seating. The boarding agent at JFK is less than enthusiastic doing their job. The flight was delayed for 2 hours. The service was adequate. The food was less than average. Since our trip with AA was a mixed experience, we would only consider AA for our future travel with a caveat - avoid booking with old air plane. The below rating is for the 2nd leg of our trip with hope AA will improve.   Horrible and inconsiderate AA Agents! This trip was a family vacation which we thoroughly enjoyed except the travel through AA airlines enroute from Chicago to Charlotte. Original flight was at 10 AM and was delayed to 2 PM due to maintenance, there was absolute no update from any agents on the terminal till 2 PM . When approached the customer service desk they mentioned that passengers will be compensated with $12 meal voucher for the inconvenience (really AA this is your class?) . Continuing the pathetic experience, after long standing and waiting we boarded at 4:30 PM CST. Was hoping that finally we will make it to Charlotte then comes a new twist. Pilot makes an announcement after 30 min into boarding that the flight is not ready for takeoff due to faulty system and we were bought back to terminal and had to off board. Saga continues. We head to AA customer service located at Terminal K to check if we can be accommodated to next flight, here we meet our super hero Greg (AA customer service representative) who was rude, shame of himself calling an AA representative. He was mean and making himself look like a fool. He didn’t want to do his job but rather show his dominance on customers as if we are asking share of his paycheck. AA if you would want to retain your loyal customers please have a thorough check on your customer service agents attitude. He didn’t want to help to get us to next flight and starts pointing fingers at us telling to call the CS from the phone located near his desk. Last but not least we are still waiting to board flight to Charlotte - it’s been 12 hrs and still waiting Will surely think twice before planning our next travel through AA.. American Airlines please consider you have lost trust of 3 loyal customers faith in you just because of your rude agent.   I have major complaints about this airline right now. We had a connection in Dallas and waited 4 hours to get on the plane. The crew was delayed from their previous flight because no one would bring them a wheelchair to help their passenger off. They finally get to us, get us boarded and fill the plane to capacity. We begin taxiing and then the pilot comes on the intercom saying the long runway in DC (where we were headed) was closed and we can’t land now because the plane has too much weight. The guy next to me was on standby and had been told he wasn’t gonna get on because the flight had too much weight, yet they still boarded everyone. We sat on the plane for over an hour. By then it’s past midnight and we go to get a new flight. Best they can do is next day and they said they can’t offer us hotel because it’s a weather related cancellation? Um, no it was due to being overweight and the crew being late. We barely got a rental car and a hotel for the night at 3 am. Not only this, but we can’t get any of our bags for 6-12 hours because it was checked baggage. So now we are stranded with no clothes, toiletries, medications, etc. American does not care. They marked all their trips canceled as weather related even though some weren’t. Super sketchy and they had no one to help us   Jacksonville to Salt Lake City. They offered the option to check your bag to your final destination. I walked up to do so. The woman behind me checked her bag as well except to a different end location. My bag went to her final destination instead of mine. On the flight I was feeling nauseous. I was going to take a Dramamine but didn’t have any water. Pushed my call button and waited and waited. Finally a flight attendant came down the aisle. She didn’t say a word to me but pushed off my call button and the one across from me and continued walking. I walked back to the back of the plane to find 2 flight attendants chatting away eating. Do they not take breaks separately so as to care for the passengers? Finally got my water and sat down. The gentleman next to me had to walk back as well. A total disregard for their job responsibilities.   I had a noon to 9 pm flight. I checked in like normal and waited 3.5 hours to board. Canceled noon flight. No drinks on flight. Landed and no handicapped assistance. I waited 45 mins in TSA through handicapped because I joined up with another lady. 20 min wait through normal TSA. They moved our gate 3 Times. I had to walk again 3 miles in 2.5 hr. Waited 50 mins in line for food vouchers and ran out of time as flight boarding in 20 mins. Landed 12:35 midnight. I screamed at associate in AA lounge because they wouldn\\'t even give me a drink. Back hurt next day so bad I spent 3 day in bed. I filed complaint 21 days ago and no response.  American Airlines cancelled my flight, due to not having enough flight attendants and then shipped my bag to the wrong place. I had to pay for a hotel, and was never reimbursed because their voucher machine was not working at the time. I never received my bag after filing two claims, and was never refunded for almost $3000 worth of snowboarding gear and clothes. They made me go through a whole process of filling out every item I had in the bag along with receipts of every item over $100 dollars and expected me to complete it within weeks of receiving the form, as if that is all I have to spend my time on. They would not even look for the bag until I completed the form. Overall a terrible experience and I am hesitant to ever fly American again if this is how they treat their customers.   You guys are absolutely awful. Making me wait 9 hours in the airport with 10 minute delays each time and after the 4th hour finally announcing that an “attendant is on the way” but really just to keep us there long enough to hopefully cancel. Ends up just kept us waiting to say the crew has timed out for legal reasons. 1) Communication would’ve been nice instead of wasting our whole day. 2) The lack of care is insane, just inconvenience after another. Just so many excuses made and lies told it’s just petty and sad. Just cancel the flight next time instead of making us wait and saying you’re too busy to talk to us. I just can’t believe how unprofessional. All the bad reviews and very deserved and I will never fly with you again.   Checkin was very complicated and not user friendly at all. We had to call their customer service and wait for hours. Our flight got delayed multiple times from 9pm to next day 11am. With no answers and no money back or support to go back with another flight. We were given a phone number to call for getting our money back and after waiting on call for about half an hour and being on the phone with them for 45min they hang up our call. Ridiculous and worst experience of my travel.   I\\'m usually not happy with this airline but this last trip they made up for it. I missed my connecting flight in Dallas and the next flight out was 10.30 the next morning so they arranged a taxi ride to and from a comped hotel suite. I really didn\\'t mind the delay after that, very nice room and I got to stay the night by the cowboys stadium! Well played AA.   Delayed flight and lost connection in NC to Tennessee and my minor daughters at the airport waiting until the next day or they would take them to a hotel alone outside the airport with the dangers of today. Call American Airline, explain the situation and me They responded like computers without putting a minute instead of a parent, that the connecting flight was not going to wait being from the same airline, inhuman and unprofessional.   This review is 5 stars for Giovanni the American Airlines representative who noticed I had been at the airport all day. She asked me this and I explained to her that my flight was delayed several times over to repair a tire and I have been here since 6:20 am and I\\'m on standby for the red eye flight. Giovanni then insisted on helping me to make sure I could get on the next flight that was at 11:59 pm. After working her magic she was the only one to guarantee me a flight to leave so I could make my connecting flight in Dallas to get to Baltimore. She went above and beyond to assist me and I am extremely grateful for her. I was told that the 11:59 pm flight was full and I was 4th in line for standby initially but Giovanni showed something different. Please hire more caring and attentive people like Giovanni. People just want to make it to their destinations and special occasions without being given the run around. Keep being the star that you were today Giovanni! Thank you tremendously! Again my rating is primarily for Giovanni. Along the way the people I spoke to over the phone and at the airport had good customer service but Giovanni saved the day for me!   When I arrived in Dallas my connecting flight was canceled. Getting help was a nightmare! They finally wanted to put me on a flight that would arrive at 11:50 pm the next night. I was going to a family reunion and would have missed all but one event. I found a flight on Southwest and booked it. Then they told me that because I was not continuing my trip with them I could not get a hotel voucher. They finally gave me one, but the hotel had bed bugs. Even the reviews for the hotel mentioned the bed bugs. Now I\\'m trying to get a refund for my canceled flight but every time I get to the part to submit my request I get an error on the page and it won\\'t go through. This was a horrible experience.   Came at 1:30pm for my flight at 4pm from Miami to Houston. Now they delayed 5 hours. Claiming was weather and lying! When I came at 1:30pm was ok an plane was already delayed. Worst company only cheap excuses!   American Airlines customer service sucks. While booking my tickets for 4 passengers (4 months before travel) and per baggage policy in American Airlines as well as in their codeshare, I had first free checked bag per passenger. I got the first free checked bag per passenger in my outbound flights. But then in the inbound flights, Qatar didn\\'t allow a free checked bag. Qatar tells me “American re-issued the tickets on 5th Jul (just 4 days before the actual inbound travel) and removed free checked bag, and thus they had to charge me.” After multiple follow ups with American Airlines customer relations, they are not even ready to tell me why they did re-issue the tickets on 5th Jul (booking was done in Feb), and why did they remove free checked bag in the re-issued ticket on 5th Jul.  American Airlines is not even ready to deeply look into what went wrong in their system/process, and not ready to refund ($420 charged total for 4 checked in bags for 4 passengers). Absolutely 100% sure mistake of American Airlines, and still not willing to give it a serious consideration. I am done with American Airlines.   Absolute worst travel and customer service experience of my life. I will never fly American Airlines again! Our flight out of Omaha got delayed 8 hours, causing us and almost everyone else on board to either miss connections, or miss their cruise ships out of Miami. The staff at the airport was rude and refused to answer any questions on why we were delayed and for how long. By the time they decided to let us all know when the flight would be leaving, there was no chance to book with another airline and still make our connections. Of course, AA had no other flights to the Grand Caymans that day, so they booked us a room in Miami and scheduled us on the first flight out of Miami the next morning. When we arrived at the hotel that AA had booked for us, the police were raiding the hotel, there were bullet holes in the floor, the place was filthy, and there was no way I was going to stay there. We called AA to have them change hotels for us and we were informed that they couldn\\'t do anything over the phone, that we would need to go back to Miami International and find an AA customer service desk to get a hotel change, otherwise we were welcome to find a hotel on our own and save the receipt and AA would reimburse us. Fine. By this time, we had been \"traveling\" (not that I would call it that) for over 18 hours and decided to just find a hotel close to the airport and call it a night. It was 8:30 pm at this time. We got a hotel and back to the airport the next morning. The flight the next morning seemed to be going smoothly until they got everyone on board and backed away from the gate. We then sat on the tarmac for over an hour and a half with no air conditioning (apparently the mechanical issue was the air conditioner). It ended up being over 90 degrees inside this airplane that was over packed. The entire time, we sat and listened to the staff laugh, joke, and complain about the \"bonuses\" they all had just received for the holiday.  Zero professionalism and rude to customers who were asking for water due to the excessive heat inside the aircraft. When we finally made it back from our trip, we submitted the request to be refunded for the hotel, our meals, and the hotel and excursion we had booked in the Caymans but were unable to make it to. AA customer relations representative would not accept some of our receipts, offered us a $200 trip credit to fly AA again and sent a check that was not even half the cost of the hotel room ($142), much less any other of our expenses. When I complained to customer relations again, I was informed that the amount I was refunded was the \"policy amount\" set for that date and location. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the person I was speaking to was the last person I would speak to, there are no supervisors, and no other departments above them. I cannot believe that an airline allows this to happen. I haven\\'t even mentioned in this review how rude the gate and flight attendants were throughout the entire trip, or that our return trip was delayed for over an hour as well. Absolutely the worst! Do not fly American Airlines.   Delayed 3 hours out of CVG, heard 3 different explanations of why, including a pilot shortage (from our pilot). Missed our layover in PHL because every American Airlines employee we spoke to refused to help us. Forced to spend the night in Philadelphia because the next plane wasn\\'t until the morning. American Airlines refused to take responsibility for our missed flight so we had to pay for the hotel ourselves. Filed a complaint to the compensation department and they gave me a laughable $25 flight credit. I will never fly American Airlines again and I will be telling all my friends and family of my experience as well. When we asked for help making our connection, the only thing the desk agent said was \"American Airlines is aware of all connecting flights\" instead of offering any kind of help whatsoever. Missed the connection by 2 minutes because the gate was not held open or reopened for us even though the plane was still at the gate upon our arrival. Literally any assistance from anybody could have avoided this whole scenario.  Milwaukee to Cancun via Philadelphia. I will not only never fly this airline again, but I will also make sure none of my friends, family, and anyone that will listen never flies with them. Original flight from Milwaukee WI, with a layover in Philadelphia and final destination in Cancun. This is what has actually happened: Flight from Milw-Philly= delayed 30 min, delayed 30 min, delayed 30 min than after two flights, we could have switched to, left their gate my AA app told me the flight was canceled. After trying to get on any other flight to get us to Cancun we were told our only option was to leave two days later or drive 4 hours to Cedar Rapids then on to Dallas with a final destination of Cancun. We drove 4 hours to CR. Cedar Rapids to Dallas flight was delayed after we sat on the plane for 20 min due to a malfunction with the fuel door. We were going to miss our connecting flight to Cancun. We called AA three times and after finally getting someone that wasn\\'t telling us there was nothing they could do we got someone to put us on another flight. The only thing is it didn\\'t leave until the next day. If it wasn\\'t for my travel agent we wouldn\\'t have even known to ask for them to cover our hotel in Dallas for the night. No one even offered. We weren\\'t offered food vouchers either. We went to get our bags to head to the hotel and nothing came on to the baggage claim belt. When we asked about our bags we were told that our bags will be on our flight the next day to Cancun and we could not get them. Not only that but my AA app was telling me that one of our bags was completely missing and not scanned. I called AA back to add two days to our trip and come back two days later. I was told they would only cover the flight if we came back one day later not two. If we extended our trip two days we would owe them $1065 per person. Not only that but in order to add an extra day we had to pay another $650 for our hotel room that would not be covered by our travel insurance. Fast forward from a night with no bags to the next day, the next flight. Dallas to Cancun. So far we have sat in this airport since our approval at 12 pm today waiting to board our 4:39 flight. In that time we have seen three flights delayed and one flight moved from Terminal A to Terminal D. At this point, it is 3:33 and our plane hasn\\'t even arrived. The flight is now delayed to 5:05 and continues to be pushed back every 10 min. Never again American Airlines.   Absolutely horrible experience. Our flight from SDF to CLT was delayed because a plane swop which meant we would miss our connecting flight to MSY so we were moved to a flight from SDF to DFW. That flight was delayed about 2 1/2 hours due to weather. So as we are still waiting for the flight to board I get notification that the connecting flight in DFW to MSY is cancelled. The gate attendant says wait to get to DFW to sort out options. The gate attendants there will assist. We get off at DFW and go to a gate agent, he says go to B1 and they’ll help. But there’s no one at B1. Walked about a mile out of the way. Then we find the customer assistance area and wait in line for an hour only to be told they do nothing about weather, our flight is now at 8:30 am and there are a couple of hotels that have shuttles we can call them to get picked up. So we ask about getting our checked bag so we can take it to the hotel. They said it would take 6 hours to retrieve it so we have to go without it. So then we called all the hotels around the airport and all of them are full. So as I type this I’m stranded at DFW all night with no food (all the restaurants are closed), no luggage with my toothbrush in it and trying to get comfortable in these awful black seats. This is the worst travel experience I’ve had. I will never travel American Airlines again.   Flight out delayed by 90 mins so rescheduled connecting flight. Connecting flight at DFW delayed an hour, then after sitting on tarmac for 90 mins returned to gate. Flight then cancelled, Sent everyone to another gate 15 minute walk away to get a hotel voucher and re-book. Line for this was 200+ people long so opted for rental car instead. Good thing because I would have stood in line for hours for a hotel voucher and the earliest rebooking flight would have gotten me to destination (Austin) at 5pm the NEXT day. Got a rental car from Budget (only one that had any cars available at 11pm) and drove to Austin, arriving at 2AM, 11 hours later than my original flight would have gotten in. On the return flights, the first plane had no air conditioning, and on the second flight the woman next to me took up not only her own seat but part of mine as well. My request for a refund on the cancelled flight - denied. Instead, I can rebook using the credit AA so generously gave me. I would rather walk then ever fly AA again. Zero stars. I feel sorry for anyone who works for this airline.  Honolulu to Dallas. I was most pleasantly surprised by an almost perfect premium experience. Full pre Covid style service delivered by an amazing friendly hard working crew. The seats, the meal, the IFE were all top of the line. I literally have not one negative comment. Thank you American for providing what all carriers should for a flight of this length in a forward cabin.   Beware - you will be treated very badly if your ever have to make a claim against this company for poor service. It makes no difference of how long you have been flying with them. Customer Service leaves a lot to be desired - following rules without any empathy or understanding of stress caused to passengers on delayed of cancelled flights. I would recommend you use another airline. My complaint was escalated but was returned to Customer Service!   Time and time again this airline fails. I stay clear of them unless absolutely necessary. Every time I\\'ve flown for business and my employer only gets AA, it\\'s either a maintenance issue or someone not showing. What kind of company runs like that? Doesn\\'t have the plane ready to go before boarding. I primarily fly Delta when ever they let me and if they can give you quality service why can\\'t AA? How are you not able to check to make sure a plane is working before having to decline everyone, and throw them to the wolves while your flight attendants make jokes in the back about the delay while passengers are fighting to find new flights with little to no help. Again, and sad to say not surprising but we\\'ll done American Airlines on your sub par service and I\\'ll make sure to fly Delta even if I have to pay out of pocket.   What a joke American Airlines has become. Don\\'t bother paying for a First class ticket because the only thing it gets you is a bigger seat. The service is such a disappointment. I traveled from RDU to CLT for the first part of my trip and during the flight at NO time did the two lead flight attendants offer anything to the first class cabin. Instead they sat up front the whole flight and chatted. They also brought full bottles of water to airline personnel that were traveling in the coach section who were non-reviving and heading home. Then they had the gall to walk through the cabin and ask for garbage because they would be to lazy to clean the plane at the end of the trip. The discussion in frost class then became the lack of customer service that was happening. I tried asking the gate agent the name of the flight attendants when i deplaned but she refused to give them to me and told me to contact customer service. Please read the generate and canned response from American airlines. This airline has become the joke in the aviation industry. The to top it off they want you to review the customer service agent begging for good reviews. [email\\xa0protected] October 23, 2022 Hello Ms. xxxxx: Thank you for contacting American Airlines.

We invite you to share your overall experience in this quick one minute survey. Click here for the survey. We appreciate your time and valuable feedback.   Absolutely disgusting. I asked the a flight attendant for some help/support to lift my backpack up to the overhead bins and he kept saying that he cannot because that’s not his job. I just asked for a little support, absolutely unbelievable! I kept telling him I couldn’t reach because I was too short and I could do it myself if I just had an extra person’s support. The trays were not thoroughly cleaned and in the pockets there was still trash. The food was also tasted disgusting. There isn’t even that many movies & tv shows to choose from. I will never be taking American Airlines ever again. An absolute trash airline! They have no respect for passengers at all.   I am very disappointed and upset of the service and resolution received by American Airlines which I thought it was a great airline, but after this trip I would never use it again. The employee at the Quito airport was very rude and overcharged me for a carryon bag that on way there was free as carryon, but she feel like it was not a carryon anymore, and charged me $45 which is even more than the $30 it normally cost to check a whole 50 lbs bag. The whole issue is that I made a complaint on my way back to the US and over a whole month later received an email just apologizing, but not a refund; when management had the chance to fix the rude treatment and unfair charge I received by their employee in Quito. I attach the pic of the same carryon bag I took there free of charge and got charged on the way back with the receipt of what I was charged $45 because according to the agent did not have change and charge me that amount!!!   Terrible! All of our flights were delayed, two were an hour delay each, one was delayed 3 hours and the last was delayed 3 times making us spend the night in the airport, never offered food or water on any flights. The only good thing was the people at the ticket counter in Miami who offered us pretzels and water while we spent the night (many thanks to them as we had 6 kids with us) Never will fly with them again!   This was by far the worse experience flying. They are constantly changing their gates so much so that my husband and I missed our first flight in Punta Cana! We asked for help several times and was denied help which would have allowed us to get to the correct area in time. We had to get another flight, which will have us arriving tomorrow. When we finally got on the first plane leaving Punta Cana, we sat on the plane in Charlotte, North Carolina for over an hour before we could get off to go to a gate! I’m writing this now while still sitting on the plane! I feel bad for those with a connecting flight because odds are, they’re going to miss it.  Knoxville to Houston via Charlotte. Uncomfortable, the flight here was even worse for 3 hours but nothing makes it worse than rude ignorant flight attendants. I remember the days were they were nice and gained respect just because but these two are rude, and not polite, or educated. If you add that to the fact that the flight is late for no reason and you are not going to make your connection with no sympathy this airline sucks. Use to be great with Delta and the reason why I was always willing to pay more. Now I know is a mistake and I need to stay with United.    American Airlines is probably the worst airline to fly on and 20 minutes wifi only. When we can go on Delta and get pretty much 2 hours of wifi time and even still we can regenerate a new url to get another 2 hours. AA needs to get with the tines and get with the program. All 6 of the passengers I flew with (some family) are in mutual agreement that this airline is pretty pathetic just on the situation of wifi usage.  Come on AA is that good business?  American Airlines sucks. Flight delayed hours and hours. You cannot talk to an actual human over the phone to help you with “fixing” it. You have to fill out a complaint form and an airline representative told me “there is no telling” when they will get back to me. Absolutely ridiculous!   I needed to get back to Milwaukee on American Airlines but it will be the very last time I will fly with them. The flight attendant was unkind and so disrespectful. I got scolded for standing too close to the man in front of me while boarding (understandable)- then got scolded again because the person I was flying with wanted to board with me. Three minutes later as the two of us were settled in I look up and there are four people standing right there by our seats (scolded before for social distancing). Then she rudely corrected me for having my foot in the aisle- I\\'m 5 foot tall - I crossed my ankle up over my knee- my foot does not even reach the aisle - I\\'m 5 foot tall. The rudeness and disrespect was amazing.  American issued a travel alert on the 26th of January for Washington Reagan for January 28 and 29th. We tried to rebook but were charged $1600 to do so. This directly violates American\\'s Travel Alert Policy. We requested a refund of this amount when we returned to Washington. We complained to American afterwords by letter and got back three emails indicating that they could not reply in a timely manner. They never responded to our request.   Worst flight experience of my life, hands down. 7am flight was canceled and I was automatically given a 7pm option which completely flushed an entire day of my vacation down the toilet. There were problems with timing for every flight I dealt with. The last plane I was on had no air conditioning for at least 45 minutes.  This was my second leg from Miami to Mexico City, I barely made it to the plane after running for 15 minutes through the terminal to connect. I was the last person to board and kept hearing my name on the intercom. Once I got settled into the plane I realized how tight the seats were compared to the 737 MAX’s. This plane did have individual televisions and the flight attendant gave me some free earphones. Flight took 3 hr 45 mins due to winds and having been put on a holding pattern for about 20 minutes. Service consisted of one drink and a bag of pretzels no extra rounds of water we’re done. Crew was okay pretty nonchalant but over all an okay flight. Ground service in Miami airport didn’t even bother to smile.   I think they have been on time once in all the flights I have taken. This morning was no different - 10 am flight delayed to noon with no explanation. Then no plane with five minutes to board. Allegedly the plane was on its way but no explanation as to why it\\'s late. Avoid American at all costs.  American Airlines delivered the worst travel experience of my life. I am a platinum frequent flier and have flown on over 15 different airlines. Internationally - they are hands down the worst. After making changes to my itinerary due to “schedule changes” that had not actually occurred (I confirmed by searching the flight status of the flights I was originally booked on, and ending up on some of those flights), they advised me that a number of flights in my itinerary were now full and I could not be rebooked. After solving this myself with the codeshare airlines they had booked me on, their advice turned out to be completely wrong and I ended up on my originally booked flights - though they continued to claim my tickets were cancelled. They then tried to cancel them again when it was confirmed I was still booked on the flights. No reason, no communication, just simply poor systems, incompetent staff and bad customer service. Once I was on my trip, they failed to issue tickets for two legs, which resulted in me spending over 6 hours on hold with their call centre, to again receive no assistance in resolving the issue. Staff from British Airways ended up helping me resolve the problem on both occasions. Their customer service and ticketing are completely and utterly incompetent and their systems are fundamentally flawed. Towards the end of my trip, they cancelled a leg of my return journey with no information as to why and no offer to re-book or resolve the issue, which resulted in me having to pay an additional $1000 to book a flight on another airline to make my connection from the US to Australia. I’m now struggling to get any kind of refund or flight credit for the flight they cancelled. On top of their administrative incompetence, their inflight service was appalling. Revolting food, rude cabin crew, filthy aircraft and shocking ground service. Their entertainment system was bad (at best) and they charge top dollar for inflight wifi that doesn’t even work. Honestly, I am extremely easy going, and always incredibly friendly to airline staff - there are just zero redeeming features for this company and I didn’t come across a single member of staff who seemed to know what they were doing or how to resolve issues their company had created. By the end of the trip I had spent over 10 hours of my vacation on hold with their customer service department to resolve issues of their creation. I wouldn’t wish a flight with American Airlines on my worst enemy, and will pay whatever is required to never fly with them again. Do yourself a favour, and avoid AA at all costs.  Miami to Charleston with American Airlines. Amid all concern for Covid-19 they did not clean the plane prior to boarding and instead were handing out wipes for you to wipe you own seat. Only they ran out of wipe and were handing out little packets of hand sanitizer, just gross.   My flight was schedules to leave at 6:32am. I got to the airport an hour early, forgot my phone in the car so had to call the parking shuttle to come back and pick me up to get my phone and bring me back. They came right away, I zipped through the security line and ran to my gate. I got to the gate at 6:18am. The customer service lady had just shut the door after letting the last passenger through as I arrived to the gate. I thought she would allow me to go through but unfortunately she refused. She said I needed to be at the gate at least 15 minutes before the flight left. I was there 14 minutes before the flight and she just barely closed the door. I begged for her to let me on the flight and she refused and said I was late and there was nothing she could do other than put me on stand by for the next flight. She had no empathy for my situation and was cold and callous. Seemed she was doing it to teach me a lesson...really?! Ridiculous customer service. I usually fly southwest but my company purchased this flight for me using points. I would never fly American Airlines by choice.   I booked a trip to Miami for my 50th Birthday, but due to COVID-19 I attempted to cancel it because everything shut down, including flights. American Airlines refused to refund my money, but insisted on giving me a credit. I advised them I could not use the credit because I just started a new job and would not be eligible for vacation prior to the credit\\'s Dec. 2020 expiration date. I travel extensively with my job, but will never use American Airlines again, and I will actively discourage others from using them. Very poor customer service. Give me Southwest any day. I don\\'t see how they can qualify for a bailout while keeping customer\\'s money!   I was returning from San Diego from a gastrointestinal surgery. I had specifically booked first class in the first seat to make things as simple as possible. As I was boarding the flight, the coach stewardess was greeting people. I informed her that I had just had surgery and needed assistance lifting my carryon into the overhead. She burst out laughing and said, \"Everyone on the plane has had surgery! Maybe someone in the back can help you,\" implying not only that she didn\\'t care but that I must be flying coach. She literally did not car. Before takeoff, the first class steward informed me that he had overheard the exchange and deeply apologized for her rudeness. This was quite nice of him and he assured me he would help take my carryon down for me at the end of the flight. However, he had also overheard the conversation and did not offer to help with put my carryon in the overhead either. Absolutely disgusting flight staff behavior. I\\'ve dealt with American\\'s rude flight staff before, but I\\'m now done with this trash airline forever.  This has to be the worst airline I have ever flown with. They are super unprofessional and do not communicate with their customers well, or at all. My aunt had to go through two random checks. Now I know one was security and that’s fine, but the other time they called her name and made her go again for no reason. The plane was running late and we boarded an hour after we were supposed to. No apologies and no one told us why we were running late. They are super rude and I will never be flying with them again. Worst experience ever.   I will never book another flight with American Airlines at Newark airport. They canceled my flight last minute as we were about to check in, and the rude man helping us did nothing of any help at all. He was extremely passive aggressive and was severely aggravating. This is sad that this is the world we have to live in now. Like I said before save your breath before you book with American Airlines at Newark airport. If I could rate this airline a 0 I would do it a million times over.   Terrible customer service, absolutely no help. Contacted the airline because I could not make my first flight due to work but was getting another flight the next day. Still needed my flight to go home, no problem. They cancelled my return flight without my knowledge and have to nerve to tell me it would be another 290 charge for the flight I already paid for. They said its because I missed my first flight, but no where in there policy it states cancellation of your paid flight. They had no help to offer what so ever.  Horrible experience! The customer service staff are so rude. No communication at all for flight changes. Its a joke to think you\\'ll be compensated or contacted by this airline. Please ride Jetblue or United! Take my word and save yourself frustration dealing with this airline and staff.   Worst airline customer service center experience. Got moved around to different CSR\\'s for same booking with multiple 30 mins to hour wait time each. Then transferred to supervisor, she gave wrong information about the flights. While being transferred from one agent to other service agents have no clue of previous conversation and no history tracking. This is basic in today\\'s world of service CRM implementation. This can be only done by cheap IT vendor or poor solution designer.\\'   It\\'s an impossible flight. Never really get a clear gate (airport screen says one, the ticket says another, the airline staff on the radio says another). Had to rush between two opposite ends of the terminal only to find out it was operated by Alaska, despite the fact that I booked everything on AA. I never got on the flight.   Not just that the professional service was close to the worst. I chose This airline because of the service of the cheaper airlines, but was serviced in the worst way possible. It\\'s also been two days and I have not yet received my luggage which is two days late. Think about this before booking your next flight with American Airlines, I know I won\\'t.   While we expected a weather delay due to the snow, we didn’t anticipate the rude and unhelpful staff. They basically sent everyone off with a “good luck” and zero information on what to do if you’d missed your connecting flight. Every ride we took from American on that trip had some kind of issue that seemed avoidable if they had any kind of organization at all. Neither of us could connect to the internet.  This airline is terrible in almost all aspects. The food quality to the service to the planes itself are shameful by any standard. Boarding on business class and I was not acknowledged in anyway. The passengers around me were offered drinks and a welcome while I was completely ignored. There was no slippers in the seat even though every other seat had one. When asked for one there didn\\'t have any, and when I tried to call the FA the light was ignored until I had to physically flag someone down. I\\'ve had better service on budget Airlines in basic economy. Wifi was suppose to be available but never able to connect the entire flight. This company should go out of business.   I have flown with 8 different airlines and out of all of them American Airlines is the absolute worst. I will not be booking with them in the future even if it saves money. Out of my 6 flights on American, they have never taken off or landed on time. They do not keep their members updated. The plane is very outdated, uncomfortable, and seems unsanitary. They have no entertainment although free WiFi is advertised, it never works and even their complimentary snacks and drinks are lacking. I am currently sitting on my flight and have been at the gate for 2 hours without any updates on the estimated time of arrival.   We boarded American Eagle flight 6086 on March 27, 2022 leaving at 3.45pm from Philadelphia Pa to Hartford Ct Bradley. After everyone was boarded and seated on the plane, the flight attendant stated that the flight was overweight and that they needed one person to offer to go off the plane and if no one volunteered they would pick someone, they said they would offer a 1050 voucher. No one volunteered and they picked a gentleman a few rows in front of us in the exit row. He was escorted off the plane. Then an American airline pilot who we saw waiting at the gate prior to the boarding was seated in that same seat! It was obvious that the “overweight” story was a lie as they seated another person in the same seat! Shame on American Airlines! We will not fly with them again. As we investigated, this action is deemed illegal because the passenger was already seated.   I will never fly with them again. I have issues with Their kiosk machine trying to check my bag in. I would still like me to upgrade to priority which was strange because the only thing he did was move me up from who classic to class for and not move my seat, which was all the way back at the back of the plane. When I called to confirm that I did not want priority because I was with a group of people, there was nothing they can do. I will never fly with them again and I will let people know about this I was as well.   Due to your customer service being unhelpful and uncompassionate, I collapsed in security and had to be treated by EMS. Needless to say, I missed my flight and had to pay $200 to continue my destination on DELTA.  I was on an AA flight from Atlanta to Detroit with a stop in Washington. AA ran out of carryon space and had me check my carryon. As we were landing in DC, I was told that my carryon was being placed on the next fight to Detroit. I told the attendant that my medicine was in that bag. I was directed to the counter, who directed me to baggage claim. I waited over two hours, at this point I was lightheaded and my mouth was dry. I told the baggage clerks that I was not feeling well. Upon receiving my bag, I took my medicine. I asked for water, they said \"no\". I asked for a water fountain, they said \"it was through security\". I asked if some could assist me through security for water and so that I would not miss my flight, they said \"no\". I moved as fast as I could to security. I was exhausted, shortness of breathe, and my chest was burning from the pills stuck in my throat. I told the lady at security that I was not feeling well.  I am thankful to the 3 EMS guys. They treated me, assisted me with obtaining another flight and back through security again.   American Airlines kept delaying my flight. What was the purpose of paying extra to change for a early flight when it still got delayed. My main issue was the female gate agent having an attitude when asked to be assisted on a flight that was leaving sooner and wasn’t full.   Due to maintenance issues, our first connection flight was delayed an hour and a half causing us to miss our flight to our destination in Cabo where we had already paid for our stay. We would only be about 20 minutes late to Dallas where we were scheduled to get on the last flight to Cabo. With all the flying we\\'ve done in the past, it\\'s pretty common for flights to wait on connections that are running late, not obsurdly late, but 15-20 minutes is not outrageous. Not only did our last flight leave on time, it left EARLY. But by that time AA had already rescheduled us for the next morning which was infuriating having to be at a wedding that we did not know if we would make considering how the first flight began. If there had been any other option at this point, we would have picked up and gone with another airline to get to where we needed to go, but there was nothing. We were given $12 meal vouchers to use in Dallas that we were told should work at most places even ordering to the room. They did not work that night. We found out from a different AA agent that they were only good to use in the airport. They did not work in the airport on the way back either. $12 does not get you much of a meal in the airport. We spent $20 on an airport Subway sandwich that we shared, two bags of chips, and nothing to drink on the way back. On top of being stuck in Dallas for the night at a hotel that smelled like dirty diapers, we had no luggage for the night and were told it would be in Cabo for us the next day. Calling customer service for help from a person is impossible. They continue to route you to complete a refund request online, any information they ask for errors when trying to process your information. I was given a customer relations email to message and was told \"they respond pretty quick\". It has been three weeks, and I have received no response. We plan to never use American Airlines again.   I will never fly again on AA. A 2 hour delay taking off in Vegas and losing even more time in the air, resulted in a missed connection home on another AA flight (to which I was charged money to get a seat assigned during check in and it wasn\\'t refunded to this date), that not only didn\\'t wait a few minutes but nothing was taken care while still in the air in order to put me in the last same day flight available to Europe. I missed a wedding the next day because of this. And in order to be home 2 days later, I had to take care of everything after landing, with people that had no idea what happened. And in this experience I also learned that AA seems to overbook most of their flights, resulting in several clients being left behind and no room to accommodate clients like me that lose connections because of AA. Horrible company!   Terrible service. Forced checked bags for 20-30 customers. Rude people at the desk when boarding. Just a joke of an airline. To anyone reading this, do yourself a favor and fly Delta. They treat people like people and don’t force people to check their bags. They also don’t keep rude people at their onboarding desk who are happy about their 2 minutes of power.   My worst travel experience. How is it that I was able to bring my surfboard to Honolulu International airport from Jacksonville International airport, but was told I couldn’t bring it back? They said it was too big, then how was I able to bring it in the first place? It’s now sitting in storage that I’m paying $20 a day for! The way I was treated by your staff at Honolulu was baffling. After arriving home after being gone for 7 months I was on the phone with your staff all day instead of catching up with family and friends. Finally was able to create a delayed bag file but still have heard nothing.   Curacao to Grand Rapids via Miami. Customer service has \"flown\" away! We were seated in the last row by the flight attendants, who must \"love\" their job. We could hear every word and they didn\\'t shut up the whole flight with complaints about it. We were served our beverages and then made to hold on to the cups and trash until our final descent. I got up to use the bathroom about an hour after the drinks were served, so I handed my cup to the flight attendant before entering the bathroom, no problem, right? Wrong! All I heard about their conversation was about customers and their trash, as if they thought I couldn\\'t hear them? Very unprofessional, not friendly people to say the least. Bags took forever to arrive at the carousels at both stops.   I will never fly American Airlines again. The first flight they wouldn’t announce my 9yr old sons allergy and the person next to me pulled out a bag of peanuts. Luckily, I was right there to stop her and she was very understanding. My 10 yr old son tripped getting off of the first flight and twisted his ankle which was no one’s fault, but it brings me to my disastrous connecting flight in charlotte. This flight was an 11pm flight and they had my 2 sons and myself in all different locations- one of which, as I already stated, has life threatening allergies so severe that he has had multiple anaphylactic reactions just from touching things that contain oils of peanuts and tree nuts, and the other now hopping around due to the twisted ankle. I explained the situation and the First Lady at the desk and she basically told me that she had no idea how to help and to come back when the other lady showed up. The other lady showed up and the First Lady made me go back to the end of the line to speak with her. Also, this was during pre-boarding and meant I would miss my opportunity to get on and wipe everything down for my allergic son. So I chose to go on and hope the attendants could help. Lady #1 gave me a ridiculous amount of grief pre-boarding and While I was in the middle of speaking with her, she started saying “ok bye. I said bye” in a condescending tone.  The flight attendants were all very nice, but were very clear that the policy stated that they could not assist at all in helping me sit with my two kids on this late flight- which, if this is a company policy as it sounds, is complete rubbish. Children should not be separated from their parents, especially on an 11pm flight and with the already stated issues going on. It put me in a position to have to plead with people and explain this very emotional and stressful issue multiple times, while in the middle of the chaotic boarding process with everyone listening. Then when we got off the flight in Boston, I went to get a chair to push my son with the twisted ankle on and the man told me I couldn’t take it… so my 10 year old had to hop all the way to the baggage claim and I found him a stray one there. To American Airlines- if you are not willing to announce peanut allergies on your flight and to tell people that they can’t eat their peanuts/tree nuts when a child with severe allergies is at risk, what gives you the right to separate them from the person who will protect them. Horrible service.  I am a disabled navy veteran, my wife and I were traveling for our 10 year anniversary. So we went all out, we left the kids with the grand parents and booked first class tickets. Upon arrival in Vegas we went to claim our luggage and found that they destroyed it and lost half the contents. We filed a claim and started going through the process. We went on with our anniversary trying to get by with most of our belongings missing. Come about a week later they are refusing to do anything to make this right without original receipts for all the items missing and since I have communicated with them they have cut the window to turn in anything from 30 days to 15 days like I need any more pressure and hardship trying to find these reciepts. So if you want nothing but a headache and to get screwed in the end do not use this company.  This is an example of shocking behaviour by AA. Never flown with them before we decided to change from BA to Miami and up to Charleston because Hurricane Ian was imminent. Changed to AA London - Philadelphia with the intention of staying 1 or 2 nights in an airport hotel (my wife had been to Philly before and we could at least explore until we could travel on) until we could fly to Charleston and then travel on to Hilton Head Island. Checked in online, and printed Boarding passes. Left home at 2am as it was an early flight. Got to Heathrow T3 only to be told we had been bumped off of the flight, and were now travelling the next day (and not even in P/Economy - which we had paid for). No reason except \"it\\'s the weather\". Yes - we know. That\\'s why we changed to go to Philly. We now had to see the Agent and got a flight in P/E to Charlotte - right into the path of the hurricane. Stayed in a Hotel for 2 days that we couldn\\'t leave because of \"the weather\" - no restaurant and no bar for night 2. A very bad experience for our first encounter with AA. See next review for the replacement flight to Charlotte.   Louisville to Milwaukee via Chicago. This airline is consistent for delays upon delays! They are so flippant even jovial about delays. I only take American if I absolutely have to. It is the worst for National travel I the US. Take any other carrier! On this particular trip, we sat waiting to both take off and deplane. The flight from CHI to MKE was far less than the time spent waiting to exit in MKE. A five year old could more strategically plan this. An entire plane sat for 25 minutes during a time when social distancing is so important staring at other doors and jetways available. Horrible planning. Inconsiderate of time. My absolute worst choice as a business traveler who takes 4-6 weekly flights. Way to be consistent with horrible service!   I purchased my husband and myself Business Class tickets from Raleigh to Porto. I noticed after purchasing the tickets that I did not have seat assignments for all the flights. So I waited a few weeks and then checked back - still no seat assignments. I tried to get the assignments online and could not do it. So, I started calling the Airlines. I called both American Airlines (whom I purchased tickets from) and then also called Iberia (whom is a codeshare on part of the flights). American referred me back to Iberia and then Iberia then referred me back to American - both stating they couldn\\'t help with seat assignments, which I found odd. American said they couldn\\'t help because Iberia was in control of the seats and Iberia said they couldn\\'t help because American sold me the tickets and were responsible for seating. The American Airlines representative even at one point said I could not get seat assignments because I wasn\\'t part of the Platinum Program - I reminded her that these were not coach tickets and that I had paid for Business Class. She then went on to say that they have problems with Iberia and can\\'t get seats assigned. She said we should have seats and when we check in at the gate they would be assigned there somewhere on the plane. I even asked if American Agent could message Iberia and make sure we had seats on the planes. She said she could not do so, but thought we would have seats if the flights weren\\'t sold out. I told here we have tickets and she said she could see we had tickets purchased in Business Class and that we should have seats on the various flights. It just seems wrong somehow that we bought Business Class tickets at $3500 per person and can\\'t get seat assignments. I can honestly say in my years of flying I have never had this problem and such poor service from two different Airlines. Lesson from my story - Don\\'t buy tickets from American Airlines as they don\\'t help you with seating. And be particularly careful if it is an American Airline flight number that shows a codeshare on another airlines   Horrible experience all around. Absolutely nothing was offered to anyone on the plane despite being delayed 2 hours sitting on the runway. Missed our connecting flight and was offered nothing in return. Missed an entire day of vacation and had to rent a car and drive 4 hours because the next flight they could put us on wasn\\'t for 36 hours. Asked if we could be reimbursed for the car rental and was told no.   Horrible experience with American Airlines. They canceled our flight back to Salt Lake with about 3 hours from boarding time. As we are walking to our gate we so happen to hear over the intercom 3 different Delta flights now boarding to Salt Lake. How can 3 different Delta flights be traveling out to our destination from different airline but American Airlines can’t fly to SLC? They told us it was canceled due to bad weather. We heard rumor that they don’t have enough flight attendants or pilots so they blame it on bad weather. We were told they would not book us another flight until 24 hours later the next night. We asked multiple times for a hotel for the night or a voucher and they would not give us anything for our troubles whatsoever. They would simply not admit that they didn’t have enough staff for our completely full flight today and simply blamed it on bad weather. The weather app showed no wind, rain, or lightning whatsoever in either city coming and going. Over 4 hours wait on the phone for customer support as well. I will never be a customer for American Airlines again. They simply do not take care of their customers. Period   First and foremost the last thing I want to be worrying about after what we just experienced is dealing or worrying about plane tickets, but right now every penny is crucial. We were in the cross way of hurricane Ian, fort myers. House gone and we were supposed to have a flight in one week, clearly, we knew that wasn’t Happening and although didn’t want to worry about it, knew we needed it cancelled and our money returned. Every single person I spoke with were so inconsiderate, lack of compassion and had the nerve to state “I understand your concern” in the mist of telling me, there is nothing they can do but Give me a new date rather than refund. The last person, manager on duty, I spoke with telling me there was no other person above him I could speak too and nothing he can do as far as refund. For a natural disaster American Airlines has No sympathy and no intend of making things right to help their customers. Fair warning to all, do not book. With Delta, we didn’t even need an explanation they heard we were affected and refunded us immediately. I am sick that what we just experienced, what we lost, still they wanted to argue and not give me a refund.   We recently traveled from Roatan, Honduras to Las Vegas, NV on flight #796 with a connection in Miami to Las Vegas flight #726 on December 12, 2023 on American Airlines. Our flight out of Roatan arrived almost 30 minutes late which left only an hour and a half to make our connection to Las Vegas. Even though we ran as fast as late 60\\'s year old people could, we got to our gate at 7:16pm for a 7:29pm departure only to find that the attendants had already closed the gate and wouldn\\'t reopen it. Apparently, they have a policy of closing the gate 15 minutes prior to the departure time - the hell with the customers that had been delayed by their own airline. My guess is to make sure they boost their \"on time arrival\" statistics. We went to the customer service desk to discuss alternatives to find out that our bags had made the flight. It\\'s inconceivable to me that. with the technology available and in use, they wouldn\\'t cross check the bags with the passengers and realize that there had been a delay. The customer service attendant and I spent almost an hour looking for flights and discussing options to finally determine that the next available flight that made any sense would be the next day. Because of the miles of red tape and caveats of American Airlines missed flight because of delays policy, we were informed that lodging and food would not be paid for - it was going to be our cost. So, at about 9:00pm we found a hotel near the airport. I have been a loyal flyer of American Airlines in the past while I was working and traveling extensively. In fact, they were the first frequent flyer program I joined back in the 1980\\'s and I was platinum level for many years. At one time, American was the premier customer service oriented airline flying. I sought them out because of their exemplary service and customer mindset. Unfortunately, they have devolved into one of the worst when it comes to that! They are more expensive than most, and their policies are nothing short of criminal. They have followed the pack in charging for bags (still at the top of the most ridiculous fees in the history of ripoffs), and become no better than Frontier or Spirit when it comes to charging extra for certain seats. It used to be at least they didn\\'t charge for the economy seats when you checked in after 24 hours in advance. Now it was a $10-12 fee to choose a seat during that time! We originally booked the flights for the economy fare of $711. A couple of months later they had dropped to $552 and, since economy bookers have zero rights, we couldn\\'t cancel and rebook. You would think that an airline making gazillions of dollars anyway would see fit to pay for a hotel and food when they made an additional $320 from us. It\\'s virtually impossible to contact a real person from American and, even if I did, I would get the stock, scripted answer regarding their policies. I don\\'t think it\\'s unreasonable for them to reimburse my costs of around $125 for them causing us to have to stay overnight after missing the flight. But customer service and common sense have disappeared from the airline industry. That\\'s why I will never fly American again and give Southwest my business - no baggage nor change fees and they at least make an attempt at providing good customer service and experiences.   Dallas to Columbus. We have been at airport for over an hour at 11 pm and there are 5 American flights all at the same baggage claim and all been waiting at least 45 minutes for bags to arrive. When we arrived at airport there was no ground crew to guide us into gate. Complete mismanagement and disorganization from American Airlines.   Terrible experience with American. They first delayed my flight 4.5 hours, and then waited until 5 minutes before boarding to cancel the flight entirely, just giving everyone enough time to make new plans, get themselves to the airport, and get their hopes up before canceling the flight at the last minute with no explanation. At 1am they offer us a $12 food credit for the restaurants that are all closed, which was insulting. Terrible airline.   Insult to injury is the best way to describe the experience. AA was delayed departing ELP. So anticipating issues with my connection in Dallas, I asked attendant for assistance. She replied she couldn\\'t help me, she did not have the \"app on her phone.\" So customers were left to help each other. Our flight arrived on time but were made to wait for a gate, and we missed our connection. There were no attendants at the gate to help reschedule passengers. The attendants at the next gate were as helpful as the absent attendants. The male offered to book us on another flight to DSM, my destination, in 2 days or would fly me to another city. When I explained that was not helpful, he threw his arms up in the air. He told me to call Customer Service if I was not satisfied. I went to the ticketing area and was informed that secondary to the pandemic, workforce reductions prevented the airline from assisting passengers in a meaningful way. The attendants on the flight did not provide connection information. I had to ask them to make an announcement to allow passengers making connection to deplane first. No one held our flight for us No one was able to re-book us on another airline. No one cared. I assumed responsibility for finding another flight to DSM the next day from the other Dallas area airport, arranged an Uber to LoveField area and booked a hotel room for the overnight stay. I called Customer Service and learned that there had been an airport malfunction and I was entitled to some compensation. I submitted my complaint on the website as directed and received a generic response. I was informed that AA is not in the habit of compensating passengers for those fees. They did not accept responsibility for the delay they created and essentially they wiped their hands clean of the situation that they created for me. I could not in good conscious recommend someone I liked fly AA. Walking to your destination would be better.   Nashville to Dallas via Omaha. Weather delays allowed minimal time to get connecting flight. The American Airline app sent me to a gate that was over 20 gates away from the actual gate. Customer Service was indifferent and when I showed the gate listed on the app they said they couldn\\'t believe it. Wouldn\\'t even look at it. Indifferent to the customer. Never again American.   This is the worst airline. We lost the first flight even though we were there half an hour before the flight left. They scheduled us for the next one and because the staff mispronounced our names, they thought we were not there and gave our places to somebody else.  I\\'ve never had that problem before.   Where do I begin. On the way to the airport I get a text message notification that my flight had been canceled. There is no further information not even a link to say why there was a cancellation. We decided to head to the airport regardless, once we get in line for American Airlines to talk to someone apparently there was a person going around telling everyone to either call a number or to download the American Airlines app. I do not know why this employee seems so insistent but I feel as though it was to get people out of line so they wouldn\\'t have a back up. I refused to get out of line and continued on to the front counter. Once I Got there, I\\'m glad I did not get out of line, they apparently they rebooked me for the following day at 2:20 in the afternoon. Mind you I did not receive any confirmation or communication regarding this flight change. The only communication I got from American Airlines was that my flight to Dallas and the other flight from Dallas to Sacramento had been canceled. The lady that helped me was very nice considering all the people she was dealing with and told me that it was canceled due to weather. Even though my phones weather radar didn\\'t really show too big of a storm over Dallas. This attendant was able to help me and booked my new flight for 9 AM to North Carolina and then from North Carolina I would to go to Sacramento. After that was said and done we leave the airport and as were leaving we\\'re here over the intercom that the flight to Dallas is now boarding mind you again my connecting flight was to Dallas. So we arrived at the airport frustrated and we left even more frustrated after hearing what was on the intercom. I finally get on the plane the next morning and make it to North Carolina. I go to the front desk and ask if I can be placed on the standby list to see if I can get an earlier flight as my flight was going to leave North Carolina at 8:30. I was told that there is only one flight that leaves North Carolina directly to Sacramento which is the flight that I\\'m on or that I was on at 8:30. As I got close to 830 I get a message that my gate has changed, so I go to the gate and it says that the flights delayed. We were supposed to board at approximately 830 we did not board until approximately 9 o\\'clock. The flight only had mild turbulence and my seat did not recline at all so I was in the upright position through the whole 5 1/2 hour flight. We get to Sacramento half an hour to 45 minutes late finally and you could see everybody just rushed out of the plane because everybody was done by that point. I will do my damnedest to never fly American Airlines again. The only part that was OK was the attendant who help me that\\'s it. I\\'d also like to mention that from Pensacola to North Carolina the flight staff showed no intention to enforce the mask mandate as I saw several people without their masks on during a time when there was no eating. It was very frustrating and I felt horribly uncomfortable sitting on the plane. Now with regards to the flight from North Carolina to Sacramento there was more enforcement of the mask rule but not by very much. There were still several people who had their masks under their nose or under their chin at a time when no one was eating and neither were those people.   \\r\\nAmerican Airlines as not adapted properly to the covid-19 epidemic. In comparison to other businesses it seems that American has had their head stuck in the sand for the last month, not even being aware that there are new procedures and rules due to covid-19. When I flew today there was no mention at check-in or on the plane about anything to do with covid-19. No social distancing, no request to wear masks, no hand sanitizing,. Within 6 feet of me there were three individuals with no masks, one who coughed frequently and became rude when I asked him to cover his mouth. When people deplaned they were close to each other breathing heavily on other people. I do not believe that American Airlines is safe for senior citizens such as myself due to failure to adapt to covid-19 precautions. American has a long long ways to go if they want to make the public feel safe flying again.  Flight was delayed 1 hour while we were already inside aircraft, then they canceled the flight and kept us waiting for 4 hours. Then after 4 hours boarding started again with no apology. Once I got to my seat it was broken and they wouldn\\'t change it, it’s a long flight from Miami to Los Angeles!   Missed my flight due to long check in line in Austin. I had an international flight from Austin to Amsterdam, with a layover in Dallas. I stood in line for 3,5 hours to be checked in to Dallas. Nobody cares about your flight, they just simply raise there arms if you ask for help.  Asked 5 different AA staff for help nobody cares. They put me on 2 flights after the one I was originally on. By the time I got to Dallas supposed agents would be at the gate helping passengers, not an agent to be seen. From there I was treated with no dignity, staff is rude and instead of helping that actually make it more difficult for the passenger. Rebooked for next day and the rest I could figure out for myself and pay out of pocket over 400 dollar extra cost. Even after talking with the supervisor, they refused help.   Just finished at 2 am after a 5 hour wait on hold to try and use flight credits that voided by midnight. AA did not honor them. Had to also make them honor a flight cancelled last minute a month ago which was not credited to my account. Terrible customer service!   Greensboro to Las Vegas via Charlotte. I will never fly American again! I fly 4-8 times a week for work. Every time I fly them something happens .. delays, cancellations, rude employees. This latest event happened when a flight from Charlotte was delayed due to air traffic at the Charlotte airport we were headed to. We left 30 mins late and then circled the Charlotte airport for another extra 15 mins. More than half the plane missed their connections. When I finally got off my commuter plane I ran (a mile it seemed) to catch my connection. I had 15 mins before it was due to take off. I arrived at the gate to find they had closed the flight (plane still there) and I wouldn\\'t be allowed to board. I asked them why they didn\\'t hold the plane knowing I was a delayed flight. I was told that no one contacted them to tell them to hold it. WTF! I\\'m so tired of American having. No regard for travelers plans. This doesn\\'t happen with other airlines! I can choose who to fly and I will never fly American again. I will drive before I ever take a commuter plane with them and I now know that American doesn\\'t care about me as a traveler.   After several poor experiences with both the airline itself and the ensuing lack of customer service, I wanted to warn others. Most recently they left me stranded in a connection city and I was forced to pay for accommodations. They also delivered my luggage (after losing it for 24 hours) soaking wet which ruined several items inside. After several attempts to contact customer service and ask for reimbursement for accommodations ($100), I finally received a reply saying sorry but we don’t cover that. After similar situations in the past, long story short is they are unreliable and have 0 customer service.   Worst experience. Flight was purchased for daughter to come home for Christmas, she boarded, sat for 2 hours and had to deplane, missed connection and missed an entire day of a 4 day trip to be with daughter for Christmas which hadn’t happen since she was 8 due to being in the military. Beyond devastated and all they can say is sorry. I know I am just one person but I will never fly American again, will gladly pay twice the amount of I have to heart broken mother. And then sent her luggage elsewhere.   No existing customer service whatsoever. Grumpy check in person, grumpy flight hostesses mainly busy with themselves, disgusting food. Highlight of the trip: someone must have driven over my aluminum Rimowa and put a V dent into the frame. The bag guy suggested I did the damage myself to get AA\\'s $85 reimbursement (for a $1000 suitcase). I would rate minus stars if I could because this is totally unacceptable! My seat was filthy from the passenger before me,  during a pandemic, where they praise themselves with sanitizing everything, plus a not explained delay of almost 2 hrs for which no one ever apologized.  American Airlines is a disgrace and I will never spend another dime on this poor excuse for an airline. The experience we- and hundreds of others- had at Charlotte Douglas Intl. yesterday was downright pathetic. Automatic check in kiosks malfunctioning leading to long lines (2.5 to 3 hrs wait time) at grossly understaffed gates leading to frustration, anger, missed flights, etc., etc., etc.... it was a disorganized disgrace, I have never seen paying customers treated so poorly. My wife ended up missing her flight, they were able to get her on another one which she made with minutes to spare, and now they\\'ve lost her luggage... so she\\'s in Brazil with just the clothes on her back. AA you owe these people an apology. But I doubt one is forthcoming because based on what I witnessed yesterday you obviously don\\'t care about your customers.   I have flown with American Airlines before and had a decent experience but I am currently in the middle of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. My husband and I were trying to return from vacation to Orlando back to Detroit. We arrived at Orlando International Airport for our flight scheduled with American Airlines, checked in and proceeded to the gate. When it became time to board they came over the PA and made and made an announcement that the flight might be canceled because they had no flight attendants. We were told to proceed to the desk for rebooting. After waiting in line for 2 hours we were given the only flight they could give us 2 days later and given meal vouchers, hotel vouchers and 2 cab vouchers. We got to the hotel and felt that maybe things would be ok. In the morning we went down to eat breakfast and were told that our meal vouchers were being declined. There were several people in the restaurant having the very same problem. We had to pay $30 out of own pocket for the worst breakfast ever since we had no car to go elsewhere. Next we tried to book a cab for the morning of our rescheduled flight and the voucher we were given was only good for 24 hours and they knew full well when giving it to us that we were delayed for 2 days. We then were forced to pay another fifty dollars for the cab for the airport after having to buy our own meals for 2 days. When I called customer service and explained the situation I was told that the only way I could straighten it out was to go to the airport to customer service (which would be a $50 cab ride and 25 minute trip each way. I explained this to the manager on duty over the phone and was told there was nothing she could do to help me. I am still in a hotel and hoping to get out in the morning if they do not cancel again. I am very shocked at the lack of caring on their part and I was only one if many people they did thIs to in my hotel.   We spent 27 hours in Saint Lucia after our flight was delayed. The airport staff was incredibly incompetent, don’t care and straight up lied to us at times. The food is mediocre at best, very limited and incredibly expensive. The outside looks like it’s been to war. There’s no where to plug your phone. The WiFi is slower than a snail. They put passengers in hotels that had no running water and blood on the sheets. Then gave us $12 food vouchers that wouldn’t even purchase a full meal. We spent $34 on Chex mix and sodas. No smoking area and denied exit after 12 hours sitting around.  After 27 hours of being stuck there, and most of it sitting in a terrible airport, the crew comes prancing out for the final time after refusing to fly all this time due to “maintenance issues”. Mind you, everyone can see the plane the whole time and no maintenance is occurring. No one went near the plane. They turned around and started walking away for about the fourth time when they were approached by several furious passengers. Then comes Captain Sam  and 10 minutes later we’re boarding the same plane that’s allegedly having maintenance issues! Once on the plane, I heard the first and only apology from the flight crew. They profusely apologized over and over. Thanks. Apologies were meaningless. We want compensation for that. Horrible experience. We will not be returning to Saint Lucia because of the airport staff and American Airlines. That experience ruined our honeymoon and Mother’s Day.   Flew on Flight 1636 from Charlotte to Denver on April 13, 2022. Flew in business class cabin with my wife Judy. We just wanted to compliment the stellar service given to us by Gary who was our attendant during the flight. His service, demeanor, sense of humor and overall greatness harkens back to the glorious days of flying prior to 9/11. He truly made this trip first class for us. Please extend our thanks and give him our highest commendations.  Travelled with family: 2 adults and 3 children under 6 yrs old. Check in was ok, let us board via priority line as we had small kids. Airplane seating, etc was ok, main issue is with the cabin staff. Not very professional. They are very abrupt, condescending and do not really make an effort to help you. I will avoid this airline at all costs in the future.  Very bad experience as usual. Delay in departing from Buffalo airport. The airplane was overweight so we have to wait for 2 passengers to give up their seats. Also arrived at Chicago airport and have to wait almost 2 hours to get off the airplane.   I have flown on 6 American Airline aircrafts in the last 6 months between Texas and California. I’m a 70 year old disabled veteran that just had his 2 complete hip replacement. I need assistance and a wheel chair when traveling.  To sum it up, with the exception of one individual, the rest which were supposedly getting me to my ticket location, were jokes, as were the airline personnel (with the exception of one). They could care less about their handicap passengers. My last flight, instead of someone handing me my canes, which I use to get on and off the planes, and helping me down the steep exit ramp first, I am left to get my canes myself, get off the aircraft after everyone has gotten off, while a full cleaning crew is purging the aircraft. No help what so ever. This is the rule, all the way across the board with this airline. I flew Southwest, what a difference all the way across the board.   The worst service possible. Never ever fly with this airline if you can avoid it. Flight attendants are terrible. The absolute worst human interaction skills possible. I have never in my life experienced such low social situation I.Q. Not only was that bad, the temperature inside the plane was unbearable, and our flight was delayed (along with every other review on here).   I booked through awards travel. However, I needed to change my flight plans. It was within 3 days of travel and so AA instructed me to cancel the flight and book the other flight. However, after I canceled the automated system refused to let me book my bee flight because it said it was a duplicate. They also never reinstated my miles, and my ticket was in fact canceled and I was not allowed to fly on it. No one at the airport could help me and there was a 3 hour wait when you call American. They offer to call you back, but when I got the call back it asked me to press a button on my keypad and then would not register that I pressed it. I tried this process with my cell phone and my mothers home phone, in both cases after waiting 3 hours for a callback the system hung up on me before I got to speak to a person. I still have never been able to get my miles back, and the rewards system never let me book my new ticket so to save my vacation I had to pay another way for the new flight. I was a loyal American customer for years now. But I doubt I will fly with them again unless it’s the only option for my route. It is now months later, I still have not received my miles back and it’s still a 3 hour call wait. I recently flew to Europe and back on Delta, flying to S Africa later this month again using Delta’s network. A trip I was regularly making booking through American in the past.   Though 50lbs is the limit for checked bag, my bag was 0.5 lbs over. Staff who was helping me check in said I have to pay overweight price or remove something. For sure I remove one t-shirt and threw it away. My worry is if I had a bigger problem how much help would I get from this airline. My sister flew with another airline and she wasn\\'t aware of transient visa in London. The representative of that airline she was using went far and beyond and changed her ticket to pass through Amsterdam instead at no extra cost. I have flew many times and never had a problem with 0.5 lb over. But their rules so I will follow but I think I will take my business elsewhere.   The in-flight entertainment system was broken for the 9 hour flight. Was broken in business class too. I purchased the WiFi access to use my mobile device to stay busy. But the food was great, cabin crew was terrific, and you made up for it by pro-actively re-booking my connection in ORD to a flight that I could actually make. Well done.   Knoxville to Charlotte. For starters this has to be the smallest plane. A full grown child would have difficulty being comfortable. The main reason for my review is the awful service with American. This is not my first time flying with AA and each time it is always a nightmare. Unfortunately, to get from A to B there is no other option. You would think after the recent incident last year and being in the news with physically removing a person from the plane that there would be efforts and strides to improve their service. I have not found this to be the case. In my most recent incident, we are running on a delay leaving very little to no time to catch my connecting flight. While still sitting on the tarmac I politely asked the stewardess if I could move to one of the many empty seats ahead of me in an effort to deplane faster and hopefully make my connecting flight. Her response was of, well, those seats cost extra money and no you cannot move. Now, mind you we\\'re fully planed and sitting here. She goes onto say, if you miss your flight I\\'m sure they\\'ll reschedule you for another flight. Really? That\\'s your answer. Really sad.  Never Flying American Airlines again! We booked our flights (for end March 30th) in October so my family could sit together. We paid extra money so we would not have to split up and the day before our flight we got put on standby. Our family got split up, and the flight crew got mad when we tried to switch seats as we boarded (we decided me and my daughter would swap to different seats considering my five year old daughter was placed next to a stranger). They were very rude to us and thankfully one of the passengers switched for my daughter\\'s sake. Then moments before takeoff we were informed not all of the bags had made it on and the company forced them to take off.  It’s a quiet Saturday morning, after perhaps the most frustrating and difficult experience of a lifetime yesterday. Tina, Nicole, and I began our day yesterday morning by getting ourselves to the Asheville Airport for our two legged trip to Las Vegas and then driving to Zion National Park for our son, Bryson\\'s, wedding this morning! When we arrived at the Asheville desk of American Airlines, we were told that our flight to Charlotte was running late, but not to worry, we would arrive in plenty of time for our connection to Las Vegas. As that flight became later, we were informed by the tickets agent at the gate that we were not going to make our connection. American had two more flights yesterday from Charlotte to Vegas and she said that we were in the numbers one, two, and three spots on stand by. She then stated with all of the delays they were experiencing in the system, we were a shoe in for the next flight. We decided to go ahead on to Charlotte and wait for the next flight four hours later. Well, that flight was over sold and we didn’t get on that flight. The next flight was two hours later and we were met with the same fate on that one, a no go! When confronting American Airlines service, informing them that we have now missed our sons wedding, and we are in Charlotte, where we don’t live, they simply throw their hands up and tell us that we’re on our own from here! To make things even more difficult, we wait around for over two hours trying to recover our luggage. That too was a failed effort and our luggage as of this morning is still somewhere in the American Airlines system between Charlotte and Las Vegas? We had to rent a car, drive home and get here at 1.30am. We will complete the drive to Asheville this morning to go and retrieve our car, and the family of the groom will miss the wedding. The most aggravating factor is, as we found out, our original flight from Charlotte to Vegas was delayed as well and we probably did arrive in Charlotte in time to make that flight. It is my belief that the flight was over sold and they chose not to inform us that we were going to make the flight so that they could accommodate other passengers that were waiting for that over sold flight as well. Instead of asking for us to volunteer to step off, and because we were in Asheville, they just didn’t tell us the flight from Charlotte to Vegas was delayed as well and we were going to make it! Every single correspondence with American personnel was difficult and frustrating. They have no concept of service nor do they care. This is the second time in a row that we have flown American and ended up getting stranded and having to rent a car to drive with no consideration from American. I was interrupted while writing this to answer the American Airlines service representatives call. I conveyed to her, just now, this exact same story of yesterday’s mis adventures, and you cannot possibly believe this, she asked me what it is that I am asking of her?! No offer of refund, no apology, no mention of compensations for the days expenses, a big fat nothing! I have flown American Airlines my entire life. This is two trips in a row that this airline has fumbled, and the nightmare of a lifetime of missing our sons wedding! I will never have anything to do with American Airlines ever again. I strongly advise anyone to give due consideration before choosing American Airlines for travel!   American is the worst airline ever. The seats are uncomfortable and don’t recline. Flights are delayed constantly. They asked me to up grade to business class but wouldn’t apply the money I already put towards more room seats. I will never fly American again.   Lousy airline. They cancel hundreds of flights on weekends with the excuse of the weather without the slightest chance of rain. They do not solve anything, they do not assign you to another flight or another airline, they just say that you choose another date. They do not return money and to help you reschedule the flight you must go to the counter where only 2 people attend, when there are 200 in line.   Flew on American Airlines on a vacation to Pennsylvania, overall staff were pleasant but seemed rushed to get service done. The CRJ-200 doing the route was cramped and quite uncomfortable, if I had not been in an emergency exit row it would have been unbearable. The airline will do in a pinch but Delta or United are overall much better.  Worst airline I\\'ve ever flown, spent 24 hours traveling then had 2 flights cancelled trying to get home, Delta and other airlines have never had this many problems, I do not recommend and I will not be flying with them again. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and I\\'ve seen better entertainment and food.   Worst experience of my life. Had to reroute because a person who should have never been allowed to be on the flight in the first place. Poor customer service from the flight attendants and lack of information from the pilot. Arrived in Orlando airport to remove the person  and then waited on the plane for hours for them to figure out legal issues and fuel up which then told us there was no fuel so had to get off the plane and then wait use in TSA again and no help from American Airlines to direct us to our new gate or tell TSA to let us through. Delayed our flight multiple times. I will never fly American Airlines again. The ignorance, disrespect, and poor customer service disgusts me and I don’t even know how they are still in business. Did not give us any vouchers or accommodations for our time and missing out on work, travel pay and car etc.   They purposely messed around until it was too late for the crew to fly. We all stood there watching them hold us for over 30 minutes after cleaning had finished. Then they told us the crew couldn\\'t fly. If they had boarded us in a timely manner we could have flown. They did this on purpose. Very unprofessional. American Airlines sucks. We had already been delayed 3hrs and had to go halfway across airport to get to a new gate.    I cannot even begin to describe the cruelty and shock that I’ve gone through in the past 36 hours at the hands of American Airlines. To start with, my flight to Miami was delayed due to weather issues in Miami. Upon arrival after a four hour delay where I missed my then connecting flight, I was told I would have to take a flight the next morning. No one offered any food vouchers or overnight accommodations because their policy apparently is that they won’t reimburse you for any weather related delays, I spent a sleepless and miserable night on the airport floor getting no sleep. Funny that the Miami airport doesn’t even have couches and you can’t even lay across chairs. Around 3 a.m,. a worker cleaning the floors with a loud vacuum cleaner literally vacuumed around the hundreds of bodies sprawled out on the floor. Around 6 a.m. I \"awoke\" to the news that my morning flight had been cancelled due to \"weather\" issues once again. Despite all the weather and flooding issues, other passengers were still getting out on various flights with American Airlines and other airlines which makes me suspect this was not completely weather related. At any rate, upon discovering that, I then spent the entire day standing in the customer rebooking lines for hours with other passengers in order to book a new flight out. I called the American Airlines customer service call center several times only to be told that the only way to rebook was in person with the rebooking center. After about 2.5 hrs in line, I made it to a desk agent who rudely explained to me that my only options were to be put on standby for an evening flight that day and a confirmed flight for 3 days out! Again, no food vouchers or overnight accommodations were permitted because the flight cancellation was due to \"weather\" issues. After leaving the line and trying to find a different flight and different destination, I finally found one. When I went to purchase it, it disappeared. After talking with other passengers, I discovered it was an issue with American Airlines website. So many people were trying to book new flights out online only to have the flights disappear as they were about to be purchased. I got in line a second time, this time for 3 and half hours. The line was super long and most of us stood there without food and water in order to maintain our places. Finally, after I got through the line again, the agent allowed me to book the new flight to a new destination for the next day. Despite my requests, no food vouchers or hotel accomodations were permitted. I had to book a hotel for $225 all at my own expense because American Airlines refused to lift a finger. Basically, I\\'ve been held prisoner for over 36 hours in this airport, being charged for food, water and my own overnight hotel. It surprises me they\\'re not charging for oxygen at this point. I do not recommend flying with this airline ever! If you can avoid it (and also avoid Miami) at all costs, please do so for your own sanity and mental health.   Rude and obnoxious man at the counter for Flight 419 on 2/21/22, departed at 11:07pm. You should never put people like him in charge of people.  People pay a lot of money and they should not be treated poorly. I did not give any attitude yet he was rude. Told me to check my approved luggage yet let many people on with more than 2 items and humongous duffle bags. I will never fly American again.  Dear American Airlines, I want to thank you for being an hour late and making me miss my connecting flight today. I enjoy sitting in a random airport for 8 hours alone waiting for the next flight, instead of having dinner with my grandson I only have 3 days with.   They scheduled our connecting flight so close to the arrival from Spokane that we missed our flight to New Orleans, had to jump through hoops to possibly get tickets on a later flight, stand in a 3 hour line, and I still think they are a bunch of liars who gave us nothing! Why not hold up the connecting flight when several people on the arriving flight get here late because of their incompetence. Thanks for ruining part of our vacation.   This was one of the worst flying experiences I have ever had. We decided to upgrade and fly first class on a special vacation from Salt Lake City to Cabo San Lucas. While in first class I expected a decent meal of some kind but all we got were cheap snacks and a soda to drink. I had requested a wheelchair weeks before with the airline to meet me in Dallas for the transfer and then Cabo San Lucas. There was no wheelchair nor could they get one in Cabo San Lucas. I also requested one to return. When we got to Salt Lake again there was no wheelchair of any kind. We requested the gate agent to get one, she supposedly did but nothing showed up for over 20 minutes. My wife found a wheelchair and had to wheel me nearly a mile to the baggage area. When we arrived in Mexico we had to fill out an immigration and customs form in order to pass through at cobble. They had none on the plane. Why not? They could’ve handed these out and everyone could’ve had them all filled out and ready to go rather than stand in the hallway and try and find a way to fill them out before we got to customs. Very poor planning on American Airlines part. Coming back from Cabo to Salt Lake again they gave us very cheap snacks just hand them around in a basket. No meal of any kind and again this was first class travel that we had purchased for a special occasion.  I will never fly American Airlines again.   The day before Thanksgiving, my grandson and I flew on American Airlines from Dallas, TX to Memphis, TN. Prior to boarding at the gate, our 1 piece of luggage was taken from us, and we were told there was no more room for carry on. Upon arriving in Memphis, I received a text from AA, stating that the luggage did not arrive with us. I talked to an AA customer service rep in the baggage claim area and was told that the luggage would arrive on Thanksgiving. The luggage arrived late on Thanksgiving as promised. When I opened my luggage, everything was soaked as if the luggage had been left out on the runway all night in the Dallas rain. I was only in Memphis for a couple of days to spend time with family, and I spent most of my time washing clothes so that we would have something clean to wear. When I arrived at the Dallas airport, I reported the incident to an AA CSR, and she printed out several forms for me to fill out and mail in. I tried to make a claim online, but the site was not user friendly and continue to ask for a claim number. I would recommend to anyone who has problems with missing or damage items in your luggage to file a claim within 24 hours, if not you may receive a generic letter asking you to file a claim with your travel insurance and that American Airlines will look forward to you flying with them again.   I watched in horror as the Gate Agent upset dozens of passengers by doing three things as they were trying to board the flight. She told several people (we are traveling from Hot PHX to very cold Milwaukee). She told these people that the jacket in their hand was their 3rd item and they would have to choose one to check. They all explained to her they would put their jacket on. She made them step out of line and put the jacket on before she would allow them to board delaying boarding and the flight. She made at least half the folks self-scan their tickets and many had trouble with this and this further delayed the flight.  Her final abuse and harassment of customers she made several who had high quality masks take their masks off and wear the loose fitting cheap rice-paper thin American Mask as she claimed their mask did not meet their standards. OF course American Airlines Management does nothing to stop staff like this from abusing their customers and when you call in to let them know you are on hold for hours and then they argue with you instead of doing anything to change this abusive behavior. American Airlines and many of their flights have become horrific experiences for passengers due to the outright abuse by staff toward customers. They are not worthy of our hard earned dollars until they address this in a real manner. Use up your miles but don’t give them your cash.   Separating families that booked together. how about you get back to providing decent service heck even logical approaches to possible issues! I booked a first class flight two months ago for my sister and I, preselected seats and now upon checkin found out my original selection was changed and you separated us to sit next to two strangers? In what world does that make sense to separate travelers who booked together when you have 3 open seats just in different rows, and your customer support line wasn\\'t of any help either. Saying, \"they don\\'t have the power to move anyone\", but your company or system had the power to separate two travelers who booked in advance? Only advice given was to talk to the desk agent. So now I\\'ll need to arrive earlier than planned to try to sort this out. Absolute worst customer support I\\'ve seen for something that should have never happened!!   My 16 year old son was the sole ticket holder for this round trip. His first trip alone and a once-in-a-life-time opportunity to attend Honor Guard Academy through Civil Air Patrol for one week with a graduation ceremony and a trip to Arlington National Cemetery. He was the only C.A.P. cadet from his state to attend. A trip that he planned for 7 months, buying uniforms, taking virtual classes, tests, etc. He was recommended nationally for this opportunity. If only I had listened to the negative reviews of AA, we would have driven the 24 hours there instead. The first day his connecting flight was cancelled at 2am, 6 hrs before leaving so no time for making an alternate plan. Then a later flight left without us being told existed. Another flight was scheduled for the next day so he missed his first day at Honor Guard Academy. At 4 am we headed to the airport trying to catch an earlier flight after his rebooked flight was delayed again. While at the airport, my son checked his bags, went through security, sat at gate and watched his flight and every other possible flight to DFW be continuously changed, and delayed. He sat with all of his last hope and possibilities being slowly destroyed over the next few hours and with no time to make alternate plans or even drive to DFW for the connection 9 hours away. American Airlines said it was weather, then maintenance. We found out it was a lie. They didn\\'t have a pilot or crew. They knew this but they didn\\'t want to cancel and have to refund our money. If they had told us sooner, we could have drove or made other arrangements. The Honor Guard Academy ordered my son\\'s Honor Guard uniform for graduation that he will never get to wear. He will not get to go, ever. Today he did not get out of bed and his two suitcases that took a week to pack full of hours-long polishing of boots, shoes, ironed and dry cleaned uniforms, ribbons earned, etc, etc now remain closed away, unpacked from his two suitcases standing silently in our living room. The trip that never left the airport. What American Airlines did to my son\\'s hopes and dreams and months of hard work to make this trip possible has all been carelessly destroyed all for profit through deception. This is unforgivable and no refund can ever fix my son\\'s broken heart.   I flew Medellin to Miami, had to check my bag in Miami because I bought something at the shops after customs. When I got to Miami ground crew verified My routing. So I went to the gate and they were delayed Incoming flight and had a mechanical issue. I then missed my connecting flight and had to argue with the lady about putting me on Alaska airlines. The lady said she wrote the baggage crew a message saying to reroute my bag but that didn’t happen. When I left Miami thinking my bag was going with me. Found out at my final destination that my bag went from Miami to Minneapolis. And the only thing they compensated for was a 100 dollars travel credit. They need to be removed from the oneworld alliance if that is how they treat there emerald status passengers. Pretty pathetic but I guess we get what we paid for.   \\r\\nPaid $4200 for first class lie flat seats on flights to Hawaii. On both outgoing and incoming flights my first class seat was broken. On return flight there were a total of 3 seats that were broken. We were not notified, not given a refund or anything. Staff was extremely rude as we were told \\'oh well\\', \\'I\\'m sure someone in coach would be happy to take your seat\\' and that \\'you were supposed to be notified\\'. We filed a complaint with AA and were only offered $150 credit on one flight and $400 credit for the other. The tickets cost $4200! Clearly AA is not maintaining their fleet and it shows. A gate agent told us that they just keep flying the planes back and forth with them not fixed. Will never fly first class on AA again.  American Airlines has the worst customer service, and is right up there with Bank of America for horrible customer relations. They must have two people answering phones for 50,000 calls. Unbelievable! Their call back service doesn’t work and I tried to reach them over a period of 23 hours, and at one point was on hold for 3.5 hrs. Finally had to hang up. I still haven’t been able to reach them! How does a company stay in business when they treat their customers like this?   Me and my fiancé were supposed to be on a cruise for our Engagement. We booked our flights with American Airlines and downloaded the app to keep watch for updates. Monitored the app for days and even hrs/mins leading up to boarding. Their website/app allows you to see where the plane you will be flying on came in from and when it landed at MCI our aircraft landed at MCI 11/25/23 at 4:32pm from CANCUN, the next morning when they were loading us multiple passengers asked to make sure we would be taking off on time because we did have some snow (it stopped around 1am) including myself we were reassured that yes we would be taking off on time. When all passengers were on board the Pilot announced take off in 15mins ... 30 mins later and we still had not moved .. 1 hr later still had not moved and nothing was said passengers started to question the flight attendants who didn\\'t know what was going on. 2 hrs in and the pilot announces that our plane had not been refuelled in the 15 hrs that it sat at the airport so we were waiting, next thing he comes on and says they notified him that our plane was never de-iced. He lets us know that they are short staffed as well and now he does not know when we will be taking off. Multiple passengers wanted off, including us and we were denied being able to get off the aircraft that was still at the terminal to book other options. 3 1/2 hrs later we finally arrived in Chicago we missed all connecting flight to our cruise. Were forced to wait in the airport for hours for a return flight and now American Airlines is trying to say that they do not owe anyone any type of compensation and not to mention they are robbing me of my time, money and returning flights that went unused.   AA\\'s plane malfunctioned and caused a half-hour delay, causing us to miss our connector in Heathrow. They didn\\'t communicate anything to us, and automatically rebooked us for a much later flight that night. They did nothing to reimburse us for our ruined first day of vacation, the missed reservations, and attempted to not even reimburse the food we had to get from the airport. They jerked us around for over a month before answering one of our complaints, and then toyed with us for over a month before blocking further communication with us. Do. Not. Fly. American.   I purchased a first class ticket with American Airlines for May 7th and without notifying me, they changed the first half of my flight to economy. I purchased the ticket on May 2nd and learned today, May 6th, when I downloaded my mobile boarding pass that my flight had been switched to economy. Upon calling customer service, I was told that there hadn’t been any seats available in first class and that was the reason I had been downgraded. The customer service rep assured me that I would still be able to enjoy all of the goodies/services that come with first class, but they should have informed me immediately that my flight had been downgraded. There was not even a mention of reimbursing me or pro-rating me for the difference a first class flight costs compared to an economy seat. If this is the way I’m treated before I even get to the airport for the flight, I am not looking forward to the actual flight experience.   Kansas City to Dallas Ft Worth. This airline is the worst. Apparently they are too lazy to print bags tags. It was clear my husband and I were flying together but clearly the gate agent could not figure that out. She sent his bag on the belt before we had time to put some of my liquids in it so I had to toss about $50 worth of items. I have flown them a couple times. Usually in first class but even their first class isn’t up to standards of other airlines. I will avoid them as much as possible from now on.   We had a wonderful experience with Kaythlenn at Logan Airport. She provided excellent customer service was very patient despite a very busy day at the airport. I have run into many attendants and no one as qualified and patient as   This Airline is horrible. My company spends hundreds of thousands of dollars a year flying is for work and literally every time there is an issue with American Airlines. Most recently today, July 16, 2021 I get to Charlotte, NC and luckily don’t have to literally sprint across the opposite end of the airport just to catch my flight. I do however arrive and have to sit and watch as my flight gets delayed FOUR times. So instead of leaving at 4:30PM, I got to leave at 6:20 PM. The lady at the counter was also very rude. Offered not even an apology for the delay, and then demanded that if you have two bags you will check one in as there will not be enough space. And this is not a new thing that I’ve noticed at American. Always rude unless you’re first class. Will never fly with them again.   Wishes I could give it a zero. I had to make a connection in Dallas from New Orleans to San Diego but the first flight was delayed so I had to change the second flight to the latest one. The first flight was delayed 3 times until suddenly we’re informed it’s cancelled. The app automatically canceled my second flight so I had to rebook both. I eventually could take another flight to Dallas (which was delayed too) while the last flight to San Diego was still boarding (delayed by an hour as well). However since my flight (with a reserved seat) was cancelled and no seat available, I had to stay at the airport. There’s a long long line waiting at the customer assistance and the line was almost not moving in more than an hou. The staff appeared not caring and helpful, not sure what they’re doing behind the computers. Will never book their flights again.   Our return flight was terrible. After the plane arrived and they knew they wanted maintenance to look at it, they did not infirm us for hours and we were traveling with a 1 year old. When our flight was rebooted, they did not have a seat available for her even though we paid for one. We then had to pay an Uber and Lyft to get to and from the hotel once they rescheduled the flight for the next day. Because there was only a 30min layover in a huge airport in DC, we decided to check all our bags which was very expensive since there were 4 of us plus a baby. When I called to request a refund, the customer service rep said she didn\\'t do that and to go online. When requesting the refund there, there was no option to refund a different card and the original card used no longer works so even though the status says refunded, it has not been nor have we been reimbursed for any of the extra expenses considering we arrived home 2 days after when we were supposed to.   Initially the plane was suppose to board at 6:20 am, so we began our journey yesterday morning at 2:30 am. After getting ready and traveling to the airport we receive a notification that the flight has been pushed pack until 10 am which is fine, we decided we would just sleep in the rental for 3 hrs, we have an infant that is traveling with us and we thought it would be best to let him sleep. Then we get notified that the flight has been pushed back to 11 which would cause us to miss our connecting flight. Customer service sucked balls, offering a different flight for $150 a person or the other option would be we could travel for 27 hrs in total vs the 11 hr one initially booked. So we had to stay an additional day, pay the additional fees, hotel fees and the return flight tomorrow still will be ridiculous.   This was the worst experience I have ever had dealing with an airline. Rude staff and the pilot was late making us miss our connection and they did nothing for the inconvenience expect book a flight for us that was the next day killing two days of our vacation, we had to get a room out of our own pocket. I urge you do not fly with them if I could give negative stars I would, one star is to good for them.  I missed my outgoing flight and they cancelled my return flight with no warning and no refund. Customer service associated couldn\\'t possibly have cared less. I am a card member but I will be cancelling my card (it was impossible to use the miles anyway) and taking my business elsewhere. Company of scam artists.   I had to cancel the flight and the wouldn\\'t refund my $1200 but said I had flight credit. I tried to use it online to book another flight and it said I had to use a representative to use it. I called and the message said I should wait until it\\'s closer to my departure date to book because they are really busy right now and the call back wait time is between 21 hours an 4 hours and 17 minutes, whatever that means. I\\'ve been waiting 3 hours for the call back so far. Their policies are archaic in light of covid and if I wait until September to book my fight, the wait times will still be the same but the prices will be much higher, if there are any seats available. Do they have any clue what they are doing over there?  I saw a little note on the website saying additional fees may apply using a representative to book my flight. I cant wait to see what that is! What a scam. They have your money and they make it near impossible to use the credit.   This is the worst experience I\\'ve ever had with an airline. My flight was changed two times with no explanation. My partner and I were not allowed to post on the first flight we switched to due to mechanical issues with our initial flight. I was then told to sprint to Terminal C from Terminal A with 15 minutes to spare. My luggage was lost in Oklahoma, and I am currently sitting in a hotel with jet lag and no necessities to properly bath. Throughout this entire ordeal, I didn\\'t receive not one apology. I will never do business with American Airlines again.  Santa Marta to Washington via Miami. Our flight that was supposed to leave from Barranquilla, Colombia on Tuesday, March 17th was cancelled on Sunday, March 15th. There was no email regarding a new itinerary, somehow we found our new itinerary at 5 pm on Sunday, American Airlines decided that we (family of 5) were leaving from Bogota, Colombia at 6 am on Monday. At that moment we were in Santa Marta, we had to quickly find and buy tickets to Bogota, which was not in our plans, sleep at the airport with 3 kids and wait there until 3:30 am when American decided to open the check-in counter. Customer service in Bogota was horrible even when getting in line to get into the aeroplane. We also had to leave our hotel earlier because of that decision American Airlines took. They didn’t communicate efficiently with us. Never flying with them again.   I had a total knee replacement and I was assigned a middle seat. I ask Guillermo at gate D21 at 9:40pm if he would change my seat due to my condition. He said in a rude tone that I would have to pay for it because nothing is free. Then he walked away and left me standing there. He didn\\'t even wait to a reply.  I wish there were other airlines that I could take but I\\'m stuck with rude people.   Initial flight was delayed three times in a span of 5 hours. Got told me and my wife would receive hotel vouchers when we arrived in Phoenix. Got here for the customer service reps to tell us they could not do that and all they could offer was food vouchers. Called up to complain about the Reno staff lying to us, just to find out that it was in fact the Phoenix staff who lied. Now we have been here for over 4 hours with no way to get a hotel and no one to give actual customer service. If you enjoy being screwed over and lied to my suggestion would be take American Airlines as often as you could. However, if you are a sane person like myself, pick any other airline. You will be much better off.   Worst airline experience consistently over the past years. You cannot preselect seats unless you pay for them on international flights. They randomly assign seats apart from each other when you booked the tickets together, and the only way you can get seats together before getting to the gate is to pay online for assigned seats. We arrived at Philadelphia airport and the luggage’s took 45 minutes to come out. All in all, AA’s service has really gone down hill in the past years while their profit sore.  New York to Palm Springs via Phoenix. We paid for our tickets round trip, and contacted American to see if we could get an earlier flight from Phoenix to Palm springs. The agent sold us an earlier flight at $98 per ticket. On the return flight, our tickets were canceled and there was no explanation given. After numerous emails back and forth with customer service \"representative\", we were told that we had not completed our flight and thus, the remainder of our ticket had been forfeited. I explained what had happened regarding purchasing an earlier flight, and was told by American that our flight in the afternoon would be canceled, however they accused us of trying to cheat the airline. More emails back and forth, and she then finally, in what she considered a magnanimous act, returned the unused portion of our tickets. By now, with $627.90 For the original tickets, $198.00, for the change to an earlier flight charge, and then $482.90 to fly home after they cancel our tickets and we\\'re not allowed to use what we already paid for, the grand total for two round trip tickets to Palm Springs became $1308.80! Now the biggest and funniest part of this whole story, is that when I went to use the unused portion of the ticket it was worthless. And the customer service agent I spoke to in Texas, was just as rude. Needless to say, I will never fly an American Airlines again. They literally could not care less about their passengers.  I have been unable to even fly out. I purchased my ticket and they have cancelled it 5 or 6 times in a row. I asked about getting my money back so I could go with a different carrier and they refused! I have a credit of close to $300 that I am unable to use and I don’t have the money to buy a complete new ticket. I wound up missing my daughters birthday and I’m on the verge of losing my new job because of it. If they cancel you this many time, you should be entitled to a damn refund!   Poor customer service from the moment you checked in. From supervisors to flight attendants. Everyone feels entitled to treat you like they want. They forget, their reason of the job is customer service! Plus blaming everything on covid.   Hong Kong to Los Angeles. Service, entertainment fine, food - not very good. My chief complaint is that the seats are the most ridiculously uncomfortable things I have ever had to endure. I recently traveled and was on 6 different airlines with 5 different carriers. This airline, by far, was the most excruciating flight I\\'ve ever had to endure. If, in the future, American Airlines is the only offering to a travel destination, I\\'ll walk instead.   What should have been a direct flight got changed at the last second to a lay over. So what should have been an hour and half lasted 6 hours instead. My flight was somehow changed at the last second so I couldn\\'t get a chance to try and get my original flight back which wasn\\'t even cancelled so I\\'m not sure why it was changed on me. So in the future I\\'m avoiding AA at all costs.   Today (October 23, 2021) we were headed back to Ohio, leaving from Maui. The morning of the flight they moved the time of the flight from 6:10pm to 8:50pm Maui time. We had to turn in our rental car at 5pm. When we got to the airport at 4:15 they wouldn\\'t let us check our bags until 3 hours before loading time (loading time was 8:05pm so we had to wait in no air conditioning until 5:05pm to check our bags. Then we get through security and are sitting at the gate when they announce at 5:45pm that our flight 116 is canceled. So they told us over the intercoms to get our bags and go to the check-in counter. We go down to the carousel where the bags for our flight is supposed to be and our bags are nowhere to be found. After waiting around the baggage carousel for 30 minutes we still see nothing. So we go to the check-in counter where there is a HUGE line. We waited in this line for 2 hours and in that time they have only helped 3 customers. I walk up and asked one of the customers what they were doing and they were handing out vouchers for food and hotel stays. It was taking on average 45 minutes per customer and we were about 30 people back in line so we booked a flight through Alaskan airlines and they got us back home on a Sunday, October 24th. This is the most unacceptable experience I\\'ve ever had with an airline. We were standing in no air conditioning for 4 hours in 85 degree weather, had to go through security twice, and not once did we even get a simple apology. I hope this company goes under so they can be forced to stop screwing over their customers. Will never fly with this company again.   Terrible experience! They board the plane then tell you there are mechanical issues. How long have you been doing this? Shouldn\\'t this be checked prior to boarding. We are all stuffed in here like sardines, no social distancing whatsoever. I\\'ve only had one interaction with the staff, so far so rude. They don\\'t offer drinks.   Indianapolis to Chicago via Milwaukee. The IND - ORD was delayed. Keep in mind that the pandemic\\'s still raging across the USA. Some many factor\\'s could be in play. Nothing was said for several minutes once pushed back from the IND gate. The cockpit crew had waited and finally had stated the delay reasons and that they were working on it. Perhaps and according to them, they were coordinating the ATC delay with their company. I understand this being a 44 years veteran airline pilot myself. Keep in mind that I\\'m traveling on a regular paid for ticket like any other public person would. However, they could of said something sooner as we had sat for many minutes. The one thing I can not ever understand is once en-route, I asked the first class cabin flight attendant about my very tight connection at Chicago\\'s ORD airport. I knew from several years ago that many times that the cockpit crew could radio or ACARS (aircraft radio and address system) a message ahead and alert the company about inbound passenger\\'s with their tighter flight connections. So, then sometimes the airline would consider holding their connecting flights depending on the number of passengers connecting to and what flights. This would especially be essential if it were the only  outbound international flight leg journey that person was connecting to. So, this F/A had just replied that he had no idea what they would do, even when I had later mentioned about my connection I was trying to make. Yes that F/A probably had felt that he had better address my inquiry and not just shun me off. Like he was initially trying to do by not really showing any level of good responsible care. So, all he really would confirm was the arrival gate and departure gate of the next connecting flight I had. And, that he had no prior experience of the gate nor it\\'s walking time, etc. How thoughtless I felt. The handling of this was so poor. The long and short was this. I barely made my flight connection to MKE from ORD after a 10 mins. walk from terminal H5 to G16. Through no help of any AA employee or on board means. The rest of my review is that during this COVID19 crisis, do not expect any level of first class service other than a nicer, roomier seat.  No food and no water nor any beverages. Only if the domestic flight is over something like 2,500 mi. per flight segment. and some time limit. All of the airlines are losing massive amounts of daily money. The U.S. government has been offering assistance though. It will be a longer road than most realize for them to bounce back. This will also decimate any decent level of airline employee service as moral is markedly down. Furloughs and major job losses loom on the horizon. Unfortunately, the airline\\'s service levels suffer. The international flights and service is somewhat better since those ticket prices are very high due to fewer flights (i.e. supply and demand). Hopefully things will eventually get better within a year or two from 2020. With more demand for traveling. People are scared.   AA45, CDG-JFK, AA2175 JFK to Bogota. Flight left exactly one hour late yet they managed to short the staff 34 \"meals.\" AAL listed this as a \"dinner\" but that\\'s deceptive. \"Dinner,\" \"Lunch,\" & \"Breakfast\" - catered flights are all hot meals. They served a cold chicken sandwich and rationed the crisps to the 34 passengers who got nothing to eat. I was seated in \"Main Cabin Extra\" and they sell this seat with the promise of complimentary beer, wine, & spirits, but again that\\'s deceptive: they don\\'t furnish those things in economy - they are blaming the public for bad behaviour when it is the staff at AAL that causes the air rage to develop, in my judgment. Also, the \"Flagship Lounge\" had no soft drinks and barely anything to eat. Don\\'t bother ever to upgrade your seat with AAL because they cannot even provide basic transportation to the public. I wish our government would reregulate these unlawful trusts.   We were made to get off a flight due to some small machine / technical issue. The flight was delayed to 10 AM and then to 3 PM which then turned in to 4:30 PM. We were told everything was good and we boarded the flight at 4:30-4:45 just to get off the flight again after sitting in there for another 90 mins. By then we had missed all other flights to Miami. We spent 15 hrs on the airport with our 4 y.o. kid. We had to cancel our trip to Punta Cana. They kept lying to us throughout. Very disappointed with the airline and the service. Also was informed by others that this is not the first time they have done this! Never flying American Airlines again.   Absolutely no social distancing - I have a musical instrument worth $30k and the cabin crew tried to snatch it out of the overhead bin (I asked her where she was taking it), she responded rudely that she would be taking it to the closet, and then left the instrument unattended for a while (so I kept watch on it). So different from Japan Airlines where they would always ask if they had to move your instrument, and would always cushion it with pillows and blankets to prevent damage.   You are the worst airline. You don’t communicate anything. You had an entire plane of passengers just sitting on the tarmac waiting and not one word was said as to why. We sat there for well over an hour and I will now miss my best friends wedding whom I haven’t seen in years because I have been serving in the military over seas. So glad I wasted $1000 on these horrible tickets.  Thank you for ruining what was supposed to be an amazing surprise.  I requested assistance when I landed in Charlotte. No assistance was given, when I asked the gate agent, mentioning I was disabled and my connect was several concourses away, her reply, \\'well just do the best you can.\\' Then I arrived at my connection gate, E17, the gate assistant told me, \\'so what? She was encouraging you.\\' WHAT? Total lack of professionalism. American Airlines SUCKS!  This was a very short flight from Charlotte North Carolina to Philadelphia. We were under an hour and 20 minutes in the air. We left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Having recently flown about the same distance or a little bit more on a Boeing 737 MAX 800 I have to say that the Airbus A321 feels a little bit more roomier. We did not have service on this flight due to turbulence, but the crew made an announcement that if anyone needed anything that they could request. I continue to be a big fan of the free Wi-Fi that I get through my cell phone provider that makes the time go so much faster even in bad turbulent weather. Overall American delivered a consistent, safe and on-time product. Thank you AA!   What was supposed to be a 12 hour day of travel ended up taking me 3 days. No customer service available (unless you stood in a mile long line for 6 hrs only to have them go home and left 100s without any assistance) even a phone call would take 5 or more hours! Once I was on hold all night, woke up to still being on hold! I ended up having to pay out of pocket for lodging and a new flight! I\\'m still fighting them for reimbursement yet they play games don\\'t get to the point and still refuse to pay for actual flight. They canceled my flight. Then they canceled another one. Then they delayed it. And once I finally got to the airport three days later for another flight they changed the gate three times in 2 hours! My app was not updated in a timely manner, and even the airport arrival departure boards had the wrong gate listed. Nobody knows what\\'s going on. All the staff seems like chicken with their heads cut off. They\\'re stressed out angry airports are hot, and all the customers are furious. It\\'s been one of the worst experiences of my life flying with American Airlines this past year. Avoid it like the plague if you can. 3 out of 3 of my trips had various issues. All kinds of excuses, or worse, no communication! They also lost my luggage. When I arrived to Guatemala I did not have my bags. It took them almost 3 days to find my luggage and finally get it to me. Of course one of my nice new hard case bags was broken. It looks like it was dropped off the plane for the amount of damage that was done to it. I am also now trying to get reimbursement for the bag. You should see the form you have to fill out if they destroy your bag or any of your belongings! They expect you to have an original receipt for every single thing that you\\'re asking for. I don\\'t know who keeps all the receipts for years of lost clothing shoes etc.  This is a horrible airline to fly with if you have multiple young children (infant/toddler age). They do not allow you to check your double stroller at the gate, which causes a logistical nightmare. They make you check it under the plane, forcing you to carry young children while dragging and/or carrying luggage through an airport. It\\'s almost impossible to get through the airport if you\\'re traveling by yourself. Especially in airports like Atlanta, Phoenix, and Honolulu where you have to walk pretty far. The fact that they have this policy, but don\\'t have a remedy in place to help families with multiple small children shows that they are not accommodating to all families.   San Jose to Los Angeles. Worst airline ever. I had a confirmed ticket but was removed from the flight because they overbooked it. It causes great deal of inconvenience. Never fly with this airline ever again.   I will drive, walk, or swim before I ever get on an American airline again. Waiting for people to get on the plane before telling them that the flight was delayed for 18 hours due to “weather” that every other aircraft company flew in to that destination. Definitely didn’t cancel the flight though because they didn’t want to pay back the money. Instead they issued most to redo their COVID test for the flight (that’s in 18 hours) which they didn’t pay for. Leaving the passengers stranded at the airport and says “go get a hotel” that they weren’t going to pay for.  They didn’t want to give anyone back their luggage but said if you needed anything it should’ve been in your carry on.   Our recent experience with American can be classified as nothing less than disastrous. Our first flight departing at 6 am was delayed 2.5 hours due to operations doing nothing after the flight crew had been delayed the night before causing them to be unable to fly at the departed time - our gate agent had no idea and we literally sat waiting as the gate agent didn\\'t know where the flight crew was until the pilot explained upon arrival. We should have missed our next flight but that flight didn\\'t have a flight crew either which we learned while waiting for almost an hour to rebook the next flight. That\\'s where we thought we lucked out but not so as the second delayed flight took off only to make an emergency landing because as pilot #2 announced \"the cabin is getting smoky and the front of the aircraft is smouldering.\" We were able to land safely (kudos to the pilots on that as we were very grateful) and deplane under threats of arrest at which point we sat in an airport for over 7 hours with 4 different iterations of what was to occur including getting a different plane to fly to our original destination at two separate times, than staying in the local of the emergency landing with no transportation to hotels 30 minutes away, to than flying to Miami to arrive and wait an hour and a half in a line to obtain a hotel and $12 meal vouchers which could basically buy a coffee at the airport. We had to wait so long at the rebooking that by the time we got to shuttle station, the shuttle was no longer running and had to take a cab for $40. The saga continued on the way home with the first delay being 30 minutes for our flight which might have enabled us to make our connection but alas, that delay turned to an hour at which time it was announced that our plane was still in Cuba. Apparently when the first delay was announced just moments before boarding, American wasn\\'t aware of where there plane was? So we were told to go to rebooking again to wait another hour and a half in line to be told we couldn\\'t get a connection from Philadelphia to Manchester until 2 pm the next day and were provide courtesy of American Airlines a night stay at the roach bag hotel which upon looking up the hotel to ensure it wasn\\'t at such a distance as our previous courtesy hotel, saw the atrocious reviews. I tried to have that changed to wait on hold for almost an hour and a half to be told we would have to go to the rebooking desk in Philadelphia to change it. Well that was a joke as the flight was so delayed the rebooking desk was closed. My spouse thought how bad could it be - well the reviews did not exaggerate - it was disgusting. We lost four days of our vacation due to the incompetence of American Airlines operations and spent more than 12 hours in lines for rebooking. Customer service is even more of a joke - American sent us 10,000 miles for the first set of flight fiascos and after lodging a complaint on round two of the incompetence. I received what appears to be a \"stock\" response that I was \"clearly disappointed\" and between both incidents given 15,000 miles which the value doesn\\'t even cover the costs of food and cabs that we incurred being stuck at airports and crummy hotels. Robert Isom announcement that he was aiming for one thing reliability - well he clearly missed that mark by a long shot as we talked to many other travelers who didn\\'t have as bad as experiences as we did but were not terribly far behind.    American Airlines is by far the worst airline I have flown on. They abandoned me and my family at JFK after an 8 hour flight, which they delayed twice and changed the gate of three times. After all that they had the worst customer service, basically telling us we couldn’t make the flight we were connecting to, even though it didn’t leave for another almost half hour, and telling us we had to find a way to get from JFK to LaGuardia, to catch a 11:30 flight the next day. Never fly American.  The day started with an early morning flight which was delayed due to mechanical issues. They were able to get us boarded but we knew our layover in Washington was going to be tight. We were able to land 30 minutes before our connecting flight. However, there was gate delays which left us running for our connecting flight. Myself and about 5 others from the same flight reached our connecting gate and were told the gate was closed and we would have to rebook. Staff at the gate was rude and unapologetic. They refused to open the gate for us even though it was still before the scheduled take off time. We were forced to rebook with a flight which would not get us in until 10 hours later. Spent the entire day in four different airports and experienced countless delays on flights ranging from leaking bathroom sinks and spots not available at the gate. Needless to say what should have been a four hour travel time turned into a 13 hour travel day thanks to American Airlines. Spent my entire birthday on top of it in airports and stuck waiting on planes. Please save your money and book with an airline that actually cares about its customers.   By far the first and last time I will ever fly on American Airlines. Our flight was supposed to be leaving at around 9am. As soon as the plane turned on you could smell fumes. The plane was stopped and we were told to exit the plane. They told us we were delayed until 11.30 am. Our original gate was 159, now they tell us we need to walk to gate 43. Our flight is again delayed till 12.30 pm and our gate has changed again to 47A. Our flight time changes again, to now 1pm. Now it’s changed to 2.30 pm. We board the plane around 2.10. We don’t take off the 3.30 pm. When we finally land the top of the plane’s left wing practically comes off and is just out going back and fourth in the air. Both planes were messed up. This entire trip was pure anxiety and frustration. Followed by a fake apology at the last minute for all the trouble we’ve gone through.  The staff at the airport in Charlotte were very rude. My sister and I was traveling taking our Mother to rest forever in West Virginia. I was using wheelchair assistance and I had to wait 15 minutes before anyone even came to take to the gate. This is just on the way up to Pittsburgh. Then my baggage with our Mothers funeral items was left in Charlotte for 3 days when I was already in West Virginia. Then on our return flight the aircraft was delayed in West Virginia for 30 minutes so we were late to Charlotte and I had to wait another 15 minutes before anyone even came to take me to the connecting flight so we were not able to get on our original flight at 11.10 am. We had to wait additional 3 hours for our flight to LAX. The emotional distress and discomfort was overwhelming.   This has been the worst flight ever. The plane broke down on the runway. The plane was returned to the gate . Flight were postponed 4 times after that. I had to sit in the airport for 9 hours.    By far the worst traveling experience I have ever had. Starting in San Diego, my plan was to go to Eagle Vail Airport in Colorado with a layover in Dallas Fort Worth. The troubles started immediately, with my flight being delayed multiple times, without clear reason as to why. Because of these delays, I would not be able to make my connecting flight. So, I contacted their customer service via phone call and the operators seemed almost clueless and were not helpful in the slightest. I had to explain multiple times my situation for them to finally understand. I had to travel to Pheonix, which that flight was of course delayed by 2 hours, then from Pheonix to Grand Junction Colorado, in which that flight I had to run across the airport because of the constant delays in San Diego. Because of this change in destination, I lost my rental car that I had booked in Eagle Vail, with no way to get there from Grand Junction. Today, July 17th, 2024, I was traveling home from Colorado, and the problems started early. My flight from Eagle Vail to Dallas Fort Worth at 2:30 pm was yet again delayed several times, eventually leaving at 6:30 PM and causing me unable to make the connecting flight to San Diego. I again contacted American Airlines and again they were useless to me. I had to call 10 times before they picked up and they decided to put me in a hotel in Dallas and then catch a flight to San Diego the next morning. However, for some reason, they did not tell me the name of the hotel but said they would email it to me. But when I landed in Dallas at 11:00 PM, there was no email. I had to call them again and was put on hold until finally, they answered. The most they could do was stick me in a filthy hotel in Dallas, 30 minutes away from the airport (in which I had to pay for the transportation). I eventually got home, not without my flight in the morning being delayed though. I am not even sure how that is possible seeing that it is one of the first flights of the day and the airplane is already at the gate. But, leave it to American to mess it up. The worst traveling experience I have ever had purely because of this Airline\\'s poor coordination and utter incompetence to help people. I will never fly American Airlines again, and I suggest you don\\'t either.   Do not waste your money on American. They delayed my first flight back so much that I could not make my layover. Then, after I rescheduled for the next day, that flight was also delayed almost 3 hours. Gate changed literally five times for the one flight, I had to cross the airport three times to reach the new gates to only be moved again. On top of this, they gave no reason for the delays and provided no communication throughout this annoying process.   My wife and I were looking for flights up to Rhode Island to go see my dying grandfather for most likely our last Christmas together. When on American Airlines website I signed up for their promotional credit card, I signed up for the one that states they give a $250 credit. We signed up for this since we love to travel and want to travel even more. After the flights were booked and we received the receipt in the email and such I called in to see why the credit was not applied. The representative stated on a recorded line that it’ll be applied during the first billing cycle. Needless to say, I got my first bill, and it wasn’t there, I called into their customer care line and after getting transferred over 8 times to include being transferred to Best Buy and being on the phone for almost an hour and a half they said that the card issued to me was not the one where I get the credit and that there is nothing they can do. They are totally incompetent and refused to do anything to make this right. I am ready to cancel the flights and close the card and never fly with them again.    I booked and paid for seats. I went to desk with correct info. I was told it was false and we were moved to regular seating then charged a 2nd time (on accident) they claim and could not refund the money for the 4 seats I didn\\'t even purchase. I have spoken to customer service and they claim it\\'s not their issue and I can\\'t get a refund for the 270 bucks they charged us. Then on the way back they removed my whole seats on accident again and put my family in all separate seats on the plane. And charged us again for seats that we didn\\'t get. I will never fly this airline again.   The worst airline ever. Don\\'t fly with this airline, you won\\'t get your luggage, it just waste of money and time the airline don\\'t even coordinate the airline don\\'t really care what happens to you.   We booked 2 tickets to Lisbon almost a month ago for April 5 from FLL with a connecting flight in PHL. The FLL got delayed one hour, after non stop running we arrived at the new gate at 9:10 for the 9:20 flight. It was too late. There were 4 other passengers as well for that flight. They said we have to come back next day for the flight at 9pm. We went to customer service to figure our options they were so rude, they had no empathy that we have paid hotel reservations that’s non refundable, it was so frustrating. Either they ignored us completely or were very rude. When they finally give a voucher for hotel for the night, they also gave us another voucher for food for 12 dollars to use at airport, A water sells for almost 4 USD at the airport. Very disrespectful! We all know delay happens, it would be valuable to communicate the reason for the delay when it happened. We sat at the gate in FLL for 3 hours. Nobody mentioned or apologized for the delay, it’s just business as usual. The customers deserve better service. Even though my tickets were Economy, they were still over 500 USD, so don’t treat me like a nobody.   American Airlines has added a route (AA3016) from San Luis Obispo to Dallas/Ft Worth. Which is a good thing except that 3hrs 23mins in an RJ is just about 1hr 23min too long! I will not try that again. The continuing flight to Boston (AA2579) was excellent in premium economy as I had great leg room. that flight actually left close to an hour late; to American\\'s good fortune the high level winds were running NE and we arrived on time.   This return trip home was a nightmare!! Weather prevented us from departing Maine but when I was able to speak with agent at counter, was reassured time after time we would make our connecting flight in Chicago. Absolutely zero interest in my telling her that flight was the last flight to EVV for the day, if we missed it we were not going to be able to get home that Saturday. Usually when she announced another delay, she made it while holding a door open to make an immediate exit after, disappearing for any questions to be asked or information gained. Upon eventual arrival in Chicago, our next flight had also been delayed but when I asked the flight attendant if she could contact our next gate to see about holding up the flight for passengers, I was told \"We can\\'t do that! We don\\'t have phones!\" along with a look like I had sprouted 2 heads. Our flight took off as we were finally getting off the first plane. We finally were able to speak with someone regarding getting home, No other flights that night (I knew that), both flights Sunday were full, can get on a flight Monday (too late, husband has to be at work Monday!), I can get you to Louisville Sunday. That is of zero help as there are no flights from Louisville to EVV on ANY airlines! Tried to find rental car ... zero luck (because it was by now after 10:00pm, they close at 10). Tried to find hotel .. zero luck. Inquired about getting our checked luggage, was told they made the flight and had just landed in EVV! After a long night of dozing in the rental car building at O\\'Hare, nothing substantial to eat since 11am Saturday, having a mask on since 11am Saturday, being told we could not sit on the floor (to lay head in seat to try and be a tad more comfortable), we were finally able to get a rental car at 6:45am Sunday to drive 6 hours home. We arrive at EVV airport, go in to collect luggage. \"Your luggage isn\\'t here, it\\'s still in Chicago!\"  No they wouldn\\'t deliver it because there had been no claim filed and they knew where it was. Counter agent got incredibly rude with us as we stood there with little to no sleep just wanting to get home! Our luggage was due in on the next flight, arriving at 4:21pm, but check the flight status on Flight Aware to be sure it is on time. I check status at 4:00, still in Chicago not scheduled to leave until after 5. Checked status again, delayed again. Checked status again, delayed. (see the pattern?) The flight finally got in to EVV just a bit after 8:00pm.... After submitting for refund for unused portion of flight (which we did get), I submitted a request for compensation on the over $300 added expense to getting home a day later than we were supposed to. I finally heard back from G.L. in Customer Relations with a form letter in which she did not change a name at the end (how I knew it was a form letter). I am absolutely dumbfounded by the lack of care whether a customer is satisfied or not. I declined the offer as I do not want to be tied to having to use this airline ever again!   This was by far the most abusive and degrading experience I have ever had traveling. I was rudely humiliated by a boarding agent because I requested to speak to a manager after my elderly mother was screamed at and berated. We were also told that our recent family death was insignificant because “people die every day” this was the most horrifying experience that I pray to god no one else has to go through. The whole incident was recorded as well.   The customer service was fabulous. They put me on an earlier flight. They even transferred my luggage in a matter of moments. It was a wonderful trip.   Salt Lake City to Miami. Kept us on tarmac an hour after landing! This happened last time I flew with AA as well. I don’t recommend! We also flew in circles around the airport for 30 minutes before landing.   Flight was canceled 10 minutes before take-off, after I had made the 4 hour drive from my home to the airport. The employees were rude and acted as if it were my fault that the flight got canceled. Offered no kind of resolution, told me all the flights were booked and basically that I needed to get over it. My flight, which was originally supposed to depart at 7:00 am, was \"rebooked\" to 4:00 pm the next day. Will never fly with this airline again. Does not respect their customers and does not have any kind of skills regarding customer service.   I recently booked 3 round trip flights for my mother, aunt, and grandmother to come see me (8 months pregnant without family around during COVID). I booked and paid for them so that they could all sit together since my grandmother is elderly and terrified of flying. However, my aunt is an employee of the state as a nurse and due to COVID her employer (the state) refused to approve her to leave the state. I called AA to cancel her flight and receive a refund, but they refused to to refund the flight and said they could give her a flight credit (but not me who paid for the flights and booked them under my account). They said there is no way for me to receive the credit, transfer the flight or credit to my name, or any other way to rectify the situation. I spent almost an hour on the phone trying to come up with a solution and the airline was absolutely unable to help or assist someone who has been a loyal customer and flown with them countless times over the last several years for both business and personal. The worst customer service possible especially during a pandemic when people are struggling financially, people are alone and isolated from their families, and the airlines were recently bailed out yet they still can’t do the right thing by their loyal customers.   This airline is consistently the worst airline I have ever dealt with. Regardless of how inexpensive their tickets are, I would advise you to fly any other airline. The small amount of money you save is not worth the headaches that come with this company. Last night, we booked a last minute flight to see my critically ill father. My flight from Birmingham to Dallas was delayed for over an hour and then sat on the runway for 20 minutes once they landed. I literally ran across the airport to my flight to Baltimore and got there just as they were closing the gates (15 minutes before the plane was leaving) - there was even a worker walking down to the plane. The worker at the gate, whose name is \"Tola\" would not let me on the plane despite the fact that I explained my previous flight was delayed and I was trying to get to my critically ill father. The worker was extremely belligerent and rude and told me he could take a flight to Dulles which was leaving in 15 minutes or spend the night in Dallas. He would rather waste a ton of resources than let me on the plane. It was clear that he was just being uncooperative and nasty. This is completely unacceptable. I will never use this airline again. I ran into multiple passengers with a similar experience and while I was using my food voucher at the nearby Denny\\'s, the waiter told me that he sees tons of people who had issues with American Airlines. \"If you want to spend an unwanted night in Dallas, just fly American\".   I never blame airlines for weather. But I do blame them for the following. We boarded and were all comfortably seated. Then we were told to get off because we don’t have a pilot and we can’t stay on the plane without a pilot. What, they didn’t know they were without a pilot when we boarded? Then after we deplaned the guy at the gate said he didn’t know when we will take off because they don’t know where the pilot was and when the pilot would be here. How can American Airlines in 2022 not know where the pilot and when they might arrive? Exhibiting clueless and incompetent actions does not instill passengers with confidence.   It is probably the worst of any American carrier! From terrible customer service to poor product to delays. Flight was delayed over five hours over first crew arrival, then maintenance and eventually paperwork for said maintenance! Finally arrived in MIA to no wheelchair assistance for over 40 mins for a first class customer! The wheelchair agent dropped me a line for assistance for hotel/rebooking as i misconnected and said he can’t stay with me or help me. Thankfully the passengers helped me only for AA to tell me no hotels are available but if i can find one they will reimburse. Now promptly i found many, i called one of them and they told they take airline hotel voucher from American and the agent from AA told me he can’t give a voucher because my flight leaves in few hours! Mind you at this point i had waited over 3 hours in a line and sat in a delayed plane in Colombia for 4 and half hours! Never again! I fly United and Delta and i was trying to not connect via BOG or PTY and thought on AA i could get home faster but no! Not only did i pay three times the fare for CTG to BNA for this day when compared to buying with United and Delta, I received terrible service only reinforcing why years ago i decided to go with Star Alliance and Delta as my back for intl travel!  It’s probably the worst fight I have ever been on. I was freezing and asked if I could have a blanket, the flight attendant said they didn’t have any. Come to find out they only offered it to First class. What kind of airline only offers blankets and refreshments to first class especially when it’s a 7 hour flight.   I am shocked that they are not practicing social distancing and they don\\'t even tell you until you are about to board the plane. I had to sit in a middle seat between two strangers for 6 hours during a global pandemic, the plane was so full I had to check my bag because there was no more space in overhead compartments. There\\'s a sign saying that they spray the seats with an antiviral coating twice a week but no other signs that the seats are cleaned between flights, there was trash in the seat back compartment of my seat. They could at least tell you what you\\'re signing up for when you buy the ticket, I wrongly assumed I could trust their judgement on health and safety measures. Customer service is also the worst. I left my phone at the gate and realized it just as I sat down, people were still boarding but they would not let me get off to quickly get my phone. I was cooperative since they said they could just mail it to me when I got home. I\\'ve been home for a week now, I\\'ve located the exact location of my phone on the find my iPhone app which says it is sitting at the guest services station at the American Airlines, but every time I call they say that they don\\'t have it and now I believe they are intentionally not answering my calls. Minimum effort public safety. Minimum effort customer service. I almost regret taking the trip, might have to pay big $$$ for a new phone and could easily have contracted COVID-19.   Do not book a flight with American Airlines if your ability to fly is in question! My intended flight starts tomorrow but I can\\'t go. American Airlines bumped me from the flight I originally picked to a different one, that would leave me in a waiting area of LAX overnight with the last leg of this flight landing after 10 p.m.  My only options are to reschedule or cancel the flight & get a refund. Alaskan Airlines does everything possible to prevent a ticket holder from doing either one. I tried using the website but it directed me to call the customer service number instead. That number has an answering system that \"due to the abnormally high number of callers\" (a standard excuse) will put you on hold forever.  The last time I tried using it, I waited two & a half hours & never heard a real human voice. The situation is obvious: once AA gets your money & sells you flight tickets, it does not care what happens. You will probably get bumped to a worse flight than the one you bought. If you can\\'t make it, the company will do whatever it takes to not refund your money. The stress of dealing with AA\\'s obstinacy triggered my two other conditions; now I really can\\'t do the trip.  7 hour flight and no meals or snacks (other than biscoff cookies). Website indicates snack boxes for purchase. Not the case for most on the flight. I didn\\'t think I needed to pack my own food for the kids because I usually fly Delta. Also, I almost missed my flight because they moved it up 2 hours and sent NO notifications of the change. Luckily I double checked my flight the night before.  Literally every time I fly American there is always a delay or problem. I fly at least 10x/year. Save yourself the trouble and do not book American Airlines. You will run into some sort of hassle that could have easily prevented but AA is poorly run. Better off flying Delta if possible.   We were delayed at security and customs in Dallas and arrived at our gate as soon as we could only to find the gate closed for boarding. The staff at the gate wasn\\'t friendly or helpful. They were aware of our delay but refused to wait. We had to book another flight 12 hours later at Dallas Airport . American Airlines offered no compensation or offer to put us up for the night or even a voucher to get some food. Not impressed with AA and will never fly them again.   AA gives these good priced promotional tickets for Japan Olympics. But then the Covid pandemic hit, and I could not get my refund back from the airlines. Instead I was told by the agency that they could only issue credit for use in the future. But another year went by and the government banned all foreigners completely. So then the different Covid and Omicron variants came out. We are senior citizens and have secondary health risk factors. So the agency and AA each point at each other to handle this matter. I was told AA would accept the use of the ticket and the balance can be used in the future. But AA says they won\\'t do it. AA only cares about its preconceived bottom line which is to make a quick buck at the suffering of the consumer. So from now on boycott American Airlines.   Worst airline I have ever flown with. Cancelled our flight over 5 times, lost our bags and left us stranded with no luggage and no where to sleep as they cancelled our flight home for over 24 hours. Pathetic staff that are too selfish to understand or even care for not only my situation, but many others situations and their only ”fix” was “sorry, here’s a toothbrush”. Staff members refused to check where our lost luggage was last at because she needed to go on her “lunch break”. Flights have been so overbooked it took them over two hours to find a solution. And lastly took four days to complete a six hour flight. Such a chaotic and unorganized airline that I will never be traveling with again.   They will not refund or transfer tickets. They will not aid you in anyway all because of policies that allow more money. I purchased a first class ticket for my one year old and myself and because of the pandemic we unexpectedly have my husband coming with us. (Things have been up in the air) but we’re moving again because of the pandemic and no longer being able to afford our apartment to Oklahoma from NY. My child will not use his seat he will be in my lap the entire time. He’s 1. Yet apparently I cannot transfer his ticket to my husbands name and my husband cannot use that seat that we paid for already! AA will do nothing to fix this or attempt to help us. They want money so bad they said buy another first class ticket for 270$ or don’t but it’s not their problem. I’m aware of company policy but the idea that during a national crisis they aren’t more Lenient and Wouldn’t do a single thing to help a family about to me homeless sickens me to my core. I couldn’t even afford the tickets I already bought. I had to buy first class to keep away from the crowds in the back of the plane with my infant and get extra bags on board (it was cheaper with how much we need to move). All they care about is money not the people and their is no help. So for anyone out their a little unsure of flying - don’t support this airline and read the fine print extra because they won’t be making exceptions for anyone even in a time of national crisis.  Minneapolis to Houston via Dallas. My flight was supposed to be at 6፡36 pm. And then it was delayed for few hours. Now the flight is going to be at 10፡50pm. I thought I would be at home before 10pm. Now I will be at Houston Hobby airport @12፡01am.. I have to be at work at 6፡30 am . This is not nice. What would be their excuses? No rain, no snow. May be no pilot? This is not nice.   The worst traveling experience I have ever had. Flights delayed to the point of missing connecting ones, unprofessional service, etc. Our first flight was delayed due to unknown circumstances, which in turn led us to rush in order to make our connecting flight which was in 20 minutes after we had landed. We rush to get our luggage, which also took forever to come out and then our connecting flight gets delayed an hour. Then it gets delayed another hour. I am sitting in the airport waiting for my next flight as I type. This entire experience has been a nightmare. Do not waste your money on American Airlines.   If you want COVID, fly American! Overbooked a flight in the middle of the pandemic. Initially had a direct flight, but switched me to indirect once they realized they couldn’t maximize profits during a global crisis.   Worst airline ever. Started our trip on September 1 to a cancelled flight due to weather despite all other airlines flying into the same location. They rebooked us for the following day at 10 pm which would cause us to miss our connection in Lima to Cusco and cause a domino effect of missed booked tours etc, not to mention paid for hotels we didn\\'t use and couldn\\'t get reimbursed for. Eventually they did rebook our original flight on Alaska airlines which flew into Dallas on time. Our connection to Lima, however, was delayed. When we finally boarded, we sat on the aircraft for 1.5 hours waiting for a copilot to show before the flight was pushed back 3 hours due to a curfew in Lima. We had to get off the plane and wait only to find out an hour later the flight was delayed until the following morning. There was a 200 person line at the customer service desk with 2 people working so we didn\\'t even bother to try for a hotel or food voucher. The next morning flight got delayed an additional hour, but we finally made it to Lima. Our trip has now ended and we were supposed to be on a morning flight September 11 at 0800 to Dallas, but the flight was delayed 5 times inside of 15 minutes and eventually rescheduled 24 hours after the inital departure time this time due to mechanical issues. The story we got was the issue couldn\\'t be fixed and they were bringing another plane in. Someone else we spoke to said there was a part they couldn\\'t get and didn\\'t know when it would arrive so who knows what the real answer is. No one on the phone for customer service could help us. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours and the best they could offer was a 30 hour travel time with 2 layovers in the opposite direction of where we needed to go only to arrive at the same time as we would if we waited until the next day (today). Just as we were about to leave for the airport this morning 5 texts came in stating the flight was delayed multiple different times. We called customer service who reassured us the flight was still happening and only delayed 20 mins. We got to the airport today and waited in line for 3 hours before receiving a text saying the flight had been canceled, but another scheduled flight to Dallas left on time. Staff directing people to the counter lines refused to give any information and were dismissive of people\\'s concerns. When we got to the ticket counter, we were told all other flight options were already booked and the best they could do was give us a flight on a different carrier at 0100 tomorrow (40 hours after our originally scheduled flight) with an additional 8 hour layover at LAX. They finally booked us with a different carrier and hopefully we will make it home 2 days late. They told us before they weren\\'t obligated to rebook us with any other carrier if the delay was 24 hours or less and that they don\\'t have any other partner airlines they can book with, yet miraculously after the 24 hour mark they can and do book us with someone else. Half of our trip time has been spent traveling and we have lost wages at work, cost of extra hotels, and food. We had a family member with a medical emergency at the end of our trip and were unable to make it home in time before they passed away. Overall, the numerous excuses, delays, lack of willingness to accommodate customers, and inability to resolve issues in a timely manner make American Airlines one of the worst companies I\\'ve traveled with. I will never use them again.  This is a long story but maybe others have had similar travel nightmares and can relate to my frustration and disappointment with American Airlines. We flew home from Cayman Islands Monday, June 26 and landed around 3:30pm in Charlotte, North Carolina. Our flight home wasn\\'t scheduled to depart until 10:30pm, but instead was delayed several times and ultimately canceled because of a potential thunderstorm. We were stranded at the airport with no transportation, and ended up staying in a filthy hotel just to have a place to sleep for the night. Our flight was rescheduled at American Airline\\'s earliest convenience, which wasn\\'t until FRIDAY. They would not offer any accommodations for us if we ended up staying. We ended up paying close to $3000 for a flight from Charlotte to Cleveland, and rented a car to get home. Altogether with the hotel, flight, food, and car rental we paid close to $3600 just to get home. I\\'m very disappointed in American Airlines and the way they are handling this situation. I can\\'t help but think of the money they can make off of people desperately trying to get home.  San Antonio to Memphis via Dallas. Staff very polite, but plane was supposed to depart at 6:20, but had maintenance issues. AA kept moving the departure time 9:30, 10:30, 12:20, 1:00, 1:30, 2:00, 2:30. They changed our gate once too. I had to change my connecting flight twice. Why couldn’t they bring another plane?   We had a group of 16 people flying to Aruba for a wedding celebration. Our flying experience was a nightmare. Flights were cancelled and moved. No one got to sit in their original seat or by others in our party. A flight cancellation stuck us all on a layover from 7 pm until 7:30 am the next day. 2 left early and bags were lost. 14 stuck in an airport overnight when hotel reserved was overbooked. What a nightmare. I don’t care if they are cheaper, they will be my last choice for all my many future flights to Aruba.   Our flight got delayed several hours because of maintenance issues. They made everyone board and then unboard which took hours in itself and they were terrible to us during that time. I realize the flight attendants were getting frustrated but the eye rolling and attitude wasn’t needed. We were ready to put that all behind us but then we get on the flight (finally) and our tray table is broken (fine we can deal with that) the wifi doesn’t work for a good while and the flight attendants are once again giving us attitude. I don’t know what it is with this airline and its flight attendants but they’re some of the meanest, most entitled people you will ever meet. I literally just asked what drinks they have when they were coming around because I didn’t know and no one told me they had a menu, I get “what? You want me to sit here and list off all the drinks for you?”. Like excuse me? Did I ask for your attitude? I respond with “well I don’t know what drinks you have but you can just show me as well” and to be honest I don’t even think she was listening to me because she goes off about how they have a menu and I need to stop being lazy. Real great way to start a flight that is causing us to spend ANOTHER night away from home. We can’t even go home tonight because of the delay we have to stay in a hotel room in some random city that they’re dropping us off in. No consideration for the day we just had and their customer service is atrocious. If it was a one off I wouldn’t even mind as much but it’s been non stop attitude from these flight attendants when we’re the ones getting screwed over. Best part, they had just finished saying over the intercom that the flight attendants were here because they wanted to help us. lol. Yeah never flying with American Airlines again and I hope they fire the girl that can’t even tell us there’s a menu nicely. Do better American Airlines. Your hospitality is absolutely atrocious   Salt Lake City to Dallas Ft Worth. Worst airline ever. Delayed from 1:40 until midnight. originally delayed until 6:30. We boarded the plan and were promptly told there were no pilots or flight crew, and were forced to deboard, where we received a delay until midnight, where they couldn’t even guarantee that we’d have a plane to board. Every time I’ve flown American, there has always been a problem. Don’t fly with them, because they don’t value your time.   Cancun to Phoenix. Oddly enough we were offered money for our seats last night from Phoenix to Boise. We declined for a reason! We were moved to the very back of the flight from Cancun to Phoenix and we were the last ones off the plane. Then we were required to go through check again. We were \"randomly\" chosen for all our bags to be inspected, taking their own sweet time. Then strangely enough the door closed before we could board. Conveniently selling our seats to an over booked flight that had all our luggage on it. I wont ever take another flight by American Airlines. And since we were moved to the back of the plane, we had a choice of 3 beverages and pretzels. My husband asked for a Dr. Pepper and the attendant laughed and said \"dont sit in the back anymore!\" Thank you for showing me what an airline shouldn\\'t do! We received hotel and restaurant vouchers to a local hotel. Upon arriving it took us 45 minutes to check in because the voucher was incorrect. We had 30 minutes to eat and with no surprise ... they give you 12.00 to spend on a menu that has very few items under 12.00. If you fly with American Airlines, pack a hefty carry on with all your essential needs inside! The hotel shuttle said there was 4 shuttles full of people that American Airlines did this too.   I will never fly this airline again. We purchased a direct flight from LIT to DCA. They changed our direct flight to one with a 30 minute layover in Charlotte. Before we even arrived at the airport our first flight got delayed by 10 minutes. No gate was listed for our flight. No one told us why we were delayed. Flight was delayed a total of 45 minutes causing us to miss our connection. I got on the app before we even took of from LIT to see what other options we had - all flights were overbooked by 10+. Go to a customer service desk and they can’t find us anything but stand by for 2 days. Offer a hotel but when you are on a week vacation - 2 days is a lot. We decide to rent a car- have to spend 4x what we planned to pay for our rental (that was already booked in DCA). So I ask for a refund - I paid them to take me from point a to b and they failed to do. After over 8 hours on the phone, numerous people telling they couldn’t help me, going to Twitter- they finally gave me a $50 (less than 13% of my original ticket) travel voucher. You can’t get them on the phone OR email. Their own employees recommended Twitter! Finally after three weeks they grant me a partial refund for the flight I missed. Final straw- my grandma flew home today. Same thing - cancelled her direct flight to give her a layover in CLT. Her flight was also delayed 30 minutes! Thankfully I had already changed her ticket to give her more layover time (over an hour). I asked for Someone to take her to her gate during her lay over AND NO ONE SHOWED. The lady on the phone and the guy at check in this morning confirmed that someone would be there. Thanks to the kindness of some strangers and her independence she was able to locate her gate. She well in her 80s and that was a lot of walking. I am beyond livid.   My daughter is 11 and flew by her self for the first time today. American Airlines have been super accommodating and very supportive when making sure she is being released into our listed contact! Calling to make sure they were there or going to be there to pick her up. Allowing both my husband and my step mom through security to take her / meet her at the gate. Making the first time flight for her very special and successful.  My fiancé, his father, and I were set to attend a wedding of a family friend. At the last minute his father was unable to attend. Since his father hasn’t traveled in over 20 years getting a credit on a future flight seemed worthless so we just left his ticket open and figured we’d use his seat as extra space since we paid for the seat. After the first flight, the airline canceled his Fathers ticket and resold the seat that we already paid for, we didn’t get a credit or anything, they unilaterally canceled and resold it! So they got paid twice for the same seat.   My wife and I had a very bad experience recently flying American. My father-in-law, died Saturday might in Philippines. Monday morning after 24 hours of non-stop preparation we arrived at the American counter at 4 am, 3 hours early for our flight. We were scheduled to fly from Baltimore to Dallas to South Korea to the Philippines. We got to the baggage checkin and were suddenly told we needed to book a return flight to board the plane to Dallas. With 25 minutes to spare before baggage check-in closed we scrambled and booked a return flight. We took the three hour flight to Dallas. We headed to our gate once in Dallas and were paged on the way there. We arrived at 10:23 am at gate D23 where the American Airlines agent hurriedly told us we would be denied boarding. She provided a printout that showed we wouldn\\'t be allowed in to the Philippines. In fact on further review the print-out showed that while I might not be able to go, my wife who had been born in the Philippines should be able to go. But in her excited state the agent repeatedly showed us the printout and claimed it was cause to deny us passage. My wife was very distraught at this news. She wanted to get home to say goodbye to her Dad. He had suffered through illness for a decade and one of the only comforts we were hoping for was to be with family. My wife pleaded with the agent and at one point she said \"How do I know if your Dad really died?\" When I spoke to the agent she turned the conversation to how hard her job was.  She said she found me \"threatening\". Exasperated I said an emphatic \"Thank You\" and walked to my wife who was crying and inconsolable against a wall. The agent did inform us that if we provided my wife\\'s birth certificate she may be able to board. Through family in the Philippines and friends in Maryland we were miraculously able to come up with the birth certificate electronically. When we provided it, she refused us boarding again. After composing ourselves we had to go to the adjoining Gate D24 to find an American Airlines agent. At that gate at about 11:30 a.m. American Airlines agent said she would give us tickets back to Baltimore as the fair exchange for not going to the Philippines. When we boarded that flight the ticket agents told us that what they had given us were not actually tickets, but they didn\\'t explain what they were. We got home by 10 p.m. the same day. I called American Airlines the next day, NC Office said there \"Was nothing they could do to help.\" and only referred me to a different number and website. She said I could use the email at the website and expect a response in two weeks. If I didn\\'t get I response I could only try writing again. There is no way to connect with American Airline leadership. They are hidden behind an internet firewall. American Airlines wants us to pay $1000 for the flight to and from Dallas-Fort Worth. They took no responsibility for what happened. or how we were treated. This doesn\\'t look right to us so we are fighting it.   Charleston to Washington. This is, time and time again, the worst airline I have ever been on. Not only is the staff extremely disrespectful, the plane is late every time. For the past 7 flights I have unwillingly taken with American, every one has been delayed. They are unprofessional, not punctual, and unaccommodating. The only positive thing about American Airlines is that they are cheaper. I do not recommend this airline.  A crazy, crowded boarding at MEX, but the plane was quiet and staff helped passengers get settled. We left 10 minutes late. Cabin staff were kind, patient and friendly. Drinks and snacks served en route. Easy flight to MIA with early arrival. The connecting flight from MIA to LGA left on time. I had seats separated from my partner, and the flight attendant seated us together, with space in-between. AA\\'s internet entertainment connection failed en route, stopping an interesting movie after an hour. Cabin staff was friendly and efficient. On-time arrival.  Cancun to Nashville via Charlotte. Worst airline ever to be so expensive. Flight was delayed so we missed our connection. American Airlines didn’t do anything to accommodate this situation and we have been given the complete run around. I will never use them again .   My son had been in the Peace Corp and I had not spent 3 Christmas\\' with him, so this year even with covid I desperately wanted to see him. My son actually purchased my tickets and made sure he obtained Direct Flights. AA changed me return flight to one with a layover. Going to Phoenix I did have a direct flight and they practiced social distancing, no one sitting directly next to me. On the flight returning not only did they change it to a layover after paying for a direct flight but they also packed us in. They did not practice the CDC guidelines of social distancing.   Upon arriving at the gate for a 33 minute in air flight, I observed another flight that was canceled with a long line of people waiting at customer service. Just then, my flight was delayed due to the absence of the flight crew. We then switched planes and gates to a larger plane to accommodate yet another canceled flight from the day before. We finally boarded with a flight crew, but after the doors were closed, we were deplaned since the crew ran out of hours. This was not an issue with the airport or with the crew, but rather with the scheduling of American airlines flights and not accounting for weather or maintenance or other imminent delays. With so many choices, why anyone would choose American Airlines after seeing hundreds of people canceled without refunds, without food vouchers, and without hotels all trying to sleep in the airport that had no open businesses this time of day is beyond me. American Airlines should be closed due to poor business practices.  Had issues last time we flew American, thought it was a fluke because they have always provided good service before. So we decided to give another try. That will be the last time. Horrible service, rude staff, inefficient. The plane was packed full. Take precautions like other airliners with covid. Will not fly again.   This is the worst experience, they cancel my early flight last minute without any excuses. Then rebooked me next day very late hours. I was late for my event plus the new flight was delayed and at the airport they were unorganized that the door to be open took forever. AA is getting worse day by day.  When I arrived at bag checking I was told the carry on bag that I have taken on numerous airlines for a number of years was too large for a carry on and that I would have to pay 90 Euros and check the bag. This would have been okay except once on the flight I noticed many bags as large or larger than the one I had to pay for. If I had to pay for a item that did not fit into the measuring cart, everyone should have to pay. It is unfair to make some pay and let other go right ahead with their items that won\\'t fit into the guidelines. I have contacted AA several times and they refuse to refund my money. This is very poor customer service and I will not fly American again if it is within my power to avoid them. I will continue to tell others about this unfair decision on their part.  Flight left on time and arrived early. Pleasant onboard experience with very pleasant, friendly, helpful flight attendant. We had a pet in cabin and as usually with AA the experience was not stressful and very nice.   6 hours of delay on our flight and airport staff had absolutely no answers as to why the flight was delayed until 2am. They were just standing there twiddling their thumbs as passengers who have been waiting for nearly 9 hours become increasingly frustrated staring at the plane we’re supposed to be on. After the delay announcement it took over an hour to finally learn why when a supervisor had come over- they didn\\'t have a flight crew. Seems like the most massive oversight on their part which is why you will never ever catch me on another American flight- I’d literally rather walk to my destination.   We were shocked when we and several others were asked to check our carry-on, because they were \"too big!\" The same\\xa0agents allowed large duffle bags which were clearly larger than our bags. The flight wasn\\'t full and there were Empty Over-head Bins upon takeoff. When I got up to go to the bathroom there were at least 10 empty seats on the plane and I mentioned the incident to a flight attendant and they say This Happens All The Time. In all the years of our flying we have never experienced such rude, indiscriminate gate agents.   American got me halfway to my destination. The connecting flight was cancelled because they could not find a captain to fly the plane. The next plane out was 5 days later. Since I was going to miss a conference the next day, there was no reason to go on to Wichita. I asked the airline to put me up for the night in Dallas and return me home the next day. Since they cancelled the flight, the airline admits that it was a trip in vain. They keep promising me a refund. They cancelled the first refund request. They submitted another refund request, but nothing has happened for over 10 days. I sent an email to the customer complaint department but have never gotten an answer. I am under the impression that they are stalling. I would ride on the back of a jackass before I would fly American Airlines again.   Supposed to leave 12.15 pm on Saturday 10/22/2021. Our gate was changed 4 times. We were told many excuses for the numerous delays but the popular one seemed to rest on a maintenance issue. Here we sit still after 2pm with no plane. Airline stated they are looking for another plane (good luck!). We have been strung along for almost two hours! Why don’t airlines simply tell the truth (late crew, scheduling screw up, etc?). Instead their credibility continues to erode daily as they’re most important thing is the convenience and profitability of the airline. That’s it! They don’t give a rip about inconveniencing customers! And, they would rather lie about the real reason for the delay rather than telling the truth. I will never purchase another ticket from American Airlines! Buyers beware! Now of course AA is “having trouble” with their website! Ha! They are a joke!   I had just finished a months long trip via Jet Blue, JAL and Vietnam Airlines and American was my last leg and the company I booked the airfare with. Besides being 4 hours delayed at DFW, the crew was terrible as was any adherence to any FAA rules. On the active taxi way, customers were up and going to the bathroom without a word from the crew, window shades were down when the announcement said they have to be up for takeoff. And the food - the plane was delayed from a 9:45 takeoff to 1200 and we didn’t depart until 12:15. And the meal in 1st class - still breakfast from the 9:45 flight - mystery omelette. Even boarding, we stood in the bridge for 10 minutes (freezing cold). What a terrible experience. Especially after being on JAL for 4 flights - how an airline is supposed to treat customers. I will do everything I can to avoid ever getting on your airline again   Boarding flight- old masks and garbage from previous people left at my seat. Clearly they are not cleaning prior to boarding. No social distancing- packed like sardines without middle seat open like other airlines. On the positive they hand you water and snack as you board.   Nothing short of a nightmare. Paid for premium economy on both flights. 1st flight they changed my seat selection. 2nd flight they took away my seat. Spent $80 dollars for nothing. I would sue them if I could, they are a disgrace and a bunch of arrogant thieves. I will never fly American again and I wouldn’t recommend them to my worst enemy.  American Airlines canceled the flight my wife and I were scheduled on, we sat at the ORF airport for five plus hours waiting for it, delay after delay. We were informed it was canceled due to the incoming flight crew from New York being unable to continue on with our fight due to the delays it incurred. While there getting the bad news with everyone else, we overheard a lady mention that this was the third day in a row the same American Airlines flight had been canceled on her. Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead and swap flight crews to enable us to fly later that evening when the plane did arrive, it caused us to have to cancel our vacation entirely. When we called American Airlines directly after we were told the flight was canceled, a representative told us they could not get us on another flight to our destination within the next few days. The customer service rep did slip up and say there was another flight with seats on it the next day but the seats were marked up to $4K each and he told us he could not put us on that fight! Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead or get us on the next flight I was not able to see my Daughter who flew out of Houston to see us, my brother and his children or my Mom and Step-Dad all of whom I have not seen for over a year. I am in the Military and nothing is more disappointing than not getting to see my family the few times a year I can, especially when it\\'s due to an airline company failing to uphold their end of a ticket purchase! Also, due to the last-minute flight cancelation, the non-refundable costs we incurred include; TWA hotel @JFK, our portion of the destination accommodations, and Airport parking for the day we waisted sitting there. My brother also flew American weeks before and had his flight canceled on him two times before he finally made it to his destination. The customer service was horrible when we were on the phone, they did nothing to assist us and were not able to answer most of the questions we had pertaining to our cancelled flight! My advice is don\\'t fly American unless you are prepared to have a week of delays in getting to your destination, it appears this is quickly becoming their standard operating procedure.  In this COVID-19 traveling era there’s not much to complain about as the airline industry has taken a financial blow that will take a while to recover from. For this particular flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to Philadelphia, American Airlines slotted a 5 year old Dreamliner, as a frequent flyer and an airplane enthusiast this was one heck of a treat and there’s nothing to complain about. Thank you AA for the sweetest 2hr ride on my favorite bird!   I am done. I am never booking with American again. Furthermore, after this most recent fiasco, I am canceling my advantage credit card with them. I don\\'t care what it does to my credit score. I am done. Got to BNA for a 2:30 flight. Delayed until 3:44. Not a big deal. But my connection from Philly to Hartford was first delayed by 4 hours (now leaving when it was supposed to land in Hartford). Then another hour. Now the gate agents are telling us there is no captain for the flight, making us wait in a freezing cold airport whose amenities are all shutting down for the night. I paid extra for this flight because it was supposed to get in at 10:30pm. Now when I get to Bradley I will have no ride. I will have to wait at Bradley until the morning (5-7 hours) before someone can come get me. Gate agents utterly unfriendly and hostile to people who paid a lot of money for these flights. I was used to them chronically being late. I was used to the planes being dirty. But this \"sorry no captain just wait and wait and wait\" business, coupled with the utter sticky grimy filth of the plane I just flew on. I will drive before I will fly with them again. Please be warned fellow travelers. American is a ripoff with terrible customer service and absolutely unreliable flights.   Objectively terrible airline. Early morning flight was delayed by 2 hours and trip plan wasn\\'t automatically booked liked Delta. If I didn\\'t wake up at 3am to check on the flight, I would have to leave on a flight the next day. I am never flying with this airline ever again. Amenities are sub par compared to Delta as well.  Due to my late arrival on ANA from NRT NH012, I had to cancel my Delta flight back to RST. I was able to book a flight AA4220 direct to Rochester MN. Checking in for my flight, I had the most rude lady checking me. There were no issues. Not sure of what the reason was. I was in no mood to even find out. Got to G13 and the flight was delayed. During boarding I was the last one in line. The two ladies working the flight were very rude and crass. This is the case with every US airline. One day they will get their justice. The flight attendant did his job and no issues with him. I do want to mention a service agent, I had left an an envelope with 1600 dollars. The gentleman found my number and called me and I went back to the airport to claim. That was an extremely nice thing for him to do. I wrote an appreciation letter to AA for his honesty. Just an average flight, nothing to get excited about.    This was the worst travel experience of my life. I experienced a bag delay on the way to my destination in Barcelona and had to wait 3 hours at the airport for my bag to arrive on the next flight. That\\'s all fine, delays happen. However, upon returning home, I am informed that both of my checked suitcases (1 of which I was forced to check despite it being a small carry-on) were in London and I needed to fill out form to submit for luggage delay. It has now been 3 days without my luggage and without the tracker provided even informing me where my bag is. I called AA and spoke to a rep who said it looks like my second bag was never scanned? They could not give me a location or any updates whatsoever. This is not only confusing but incredibly disappointing and frustrating as I had valuables and gifts for friends and family from abroad. I will never fly with this airline again, first, last, and absolutely worst experience ever (not to mention the meal of pasta given on the aircraft contained a small pebble in the sauce- irrelevant to the bags being lost but gross and disgusting).  American Airlines is the worst airline I’ve ever used, and they don’t care about their customers. They cost me over $500, and the whole group I was traveling with close to $1400, after complaining and asking for just a refund on my flight tickets all I got was a $125 credit to fly with them again which wouldn’t even cover the cost of another trip. I don’t trust that awful airline to want to use the credit anyways. It took us weeks to budget in for our trip so the added cost, due to their own inconvenience. The least they could do is give me my money back. We had problems with checking in our bags, rude staff, canceled flights, lost luggage, they put us in a cheap dirty run down hotel for the night, that was so dirty and damp that we had to get a different hotel. They didn’t give us any Uber or food credits.   I purchased a ticket from Sint Maartin to Little Rock via Charlotte in October 2022 to travel on 2-14-23. The Charlotte to Little Rock departure was later changed so that I could not make the connection. I was not told of this change and my flight from Sint Maartin was left as \"pending\". By the time I became aware of the situation, the \"pending\" flight was completely full. This meant that I would arrive two days after originally scheduled. Since I had to administer a test (I teach at a university) before the rescheduled arrival, I had to purchase a ticket on Delta to get back in time ($495 extra cost). When I filed a complaint with American, they awarded me a $50 voucher.  If your looking for an airline avoid this one at all costs. They are the greediest damn airline I have ever seen. They will upcharge you on anything they can, I paid an extra 100$ for switching my flight time minutes after buying my ticket, paid extra for bags when I usually get them for free as a veteran, ordered 2 snacks and a drink and it was over 30$ (for reference I ordered more with Allegiant and spent half that price), overcharge you for wifi, they manhandled and broke my suitcase, please go elsewhere they are absolutely horrible and disgustingly greedy.  Check-in at SJU was nice and easy. No fast track, though. First flight was delayed by 90 minutes because of thunderstorm in SJU. Cabin crew, food, drinks as well as entertainment were good in the first flight. I had to run in CLT to make the connection. I made it, my luggage did not. I was pleasantly surprised when arriving in MSY I got an email to make arrrangements online to get my baggage delivered, so I did not have to wait to make the claim in person as it was late. Things to improve: food in the CLT-MSY was quite basic: a drink and a pack of crisps. At least a sandwich in a 2 hour flight would make it better. Also, I could not enter any VIP lounge. Flying business I took it for granted, as this is a common policy in Europe. My luggage was delivered to my hotel 24 hours later, so not too bad. Still, I would fly with them again.   I am a 67-year-old woman who was flying alone. My direct redeye flight was canceled and I was told it’s weather related so vouchers aren’t given. That became the least of my problems. My new American Airlines flight from JFK to CLT was fine. The second flight to RDU was canceled. I was unable to pull up my boarding pass for the next flight, so I stopped at a gate agent, handed him my license and told him my last name. He printed me a ticket. After many confusing texts from American Airlines about gate changes, I stopped at Customer Assist to get the correct gate. I handed my license and my paper ticket to her. She told me the gate. While on a full plane, I am approached by American Airlines staff who asked me my last name. I frantically try to get my license out. I am told I am sitting in another person seat. Their last name started with the same letters. Apparently, the agent that gave me the paper ticket never looked at my license, but upon hearing me state my name found this man’s ticket and issued it to me. I tried to explain through my panic and tears the situation. As I was escorted off the plane, humiliated and frantic, I apologized to the passengers whose flight I delayed. The gate agent at that area gave me my correct paper ticket although unsympathetic. I was then told my plane which was taking off in a few minutes and of course the gate was on the other side of the terminal. I ran through the crowds at the very large and spread out Charlotte airport. The gate agent there was the only one who showed me kindness after seeing my demeanor. This was not only unacceptable but unavoidable. I am writing this four days later and I am still upset over this experience.   Do to business needs, I had to cancel a flight that I used airline miles to upgrade. I then rebooked another flight on American for the same flights, just a different day. They refused to give me my miles back because I voluntarily canceled my flight. I did not voluntarily cancel. I was required to change my flights due to business needs. I fly almost every week and was very tired of the terrible flight attendants on United and dislike the open seating on Southwest. My plan was to make American my new regular airline. Not now. They just lost about $10k per year from me because they don\\'t want to give me the miles back. Their loss.   Our (party of 5, one is pregnant) party had a connecting flight from LGA thru DGW to ABQ. Our first flight was delayed and our connecting flight was not. We asked the attendant to help us make our flight from the first flight and she did not. When we landed, 2 of us ran to the connecting gate and when we arrived the staff was rude. When I tried to explain the situation, they cut me off from talking, and instructed me to get on the plane. I tried again to explain we had a pregnant person with us that could not run, which they proceeded to tell me it was my fault for scheduling my flight through Dallas. I suggested maybe next time making an announcement or updating the time on the app, which they proceeded to cut me off and commanded me to breathe. I was out of breath from running in full sprint because no one let us know our flight would be held and I was out of breath from the situation this airline caused with a lack of communication. I’ve been on flights with Frontier where they are more helpful and responsive with delays and they’re considered bottom of the barrel. In the future, I will be avoiding American Airlines when I can.   We never got to fly because of covid. They did extend out our flight credit for a year, then 6 more months after that. Then American Airlines was no longer available at the Joplin Airport, which is only 20min from me, which is why we went through them in the first place. The closest airport to us now is a 2 hour drive. I requested a refund and was denied because my flight credit had \"expired.\" So why did I receive an email stating that it had been extended through September 2022? Of course, I still haven\\'t received an answer, even after forwarding the email about the extension. $1000 was paid for nothing! And with all the flight Cancellations, we are not about to get stranded somewhere. Never again will I ever use AA. They stole my money!  There was no water or drink offered in first class until 45 minutes into our first delayed flight. There was no screen available for TV or movies in first class. The airline did not state the reason for our delay. Airline rebooked our connecting flight that we missed since our first flight was delayed for unknown reasons. Their rebooking added a leg and then did not get us in on time (again) for a different connecting flight. This has been a hot mess.   American Airlines has to be the most jumbled mess of an airline that I have ever flown on in my life. My children and I have been stranded in Charlotte for over 13 hours. Berated and yelled at by the AA staff things like (at 12am when we landed) stating they would not release our bags, doesn’t matter if we have medicine in them that we need or not we aren’t getting OUR bags. The overnight staff were some of the most unprofessional staff I have ever come in contact with. They give no cares about anyone here. I heard a TSA agent say close to 3000 people were stranded. We have never been offered water or snacks, we cannot go back upstairs to get food and there are mo options other than a single overpriced vending machine that was half stocked. My children have slept on the floor now for over 7 hours.  And not ONE AA employee or management has come by to any of us, some passengers have infants for gods sakes and they are even holding their car seats!! This airline, this staff at CLT for AA is a joke. So much so the local news came and did interview. This is not right. Not to mention we still don’t have our checked luggage and the current wait after we have been here for 13 HOURS is 3-4 more hours. There are no rental cars, no hotels and over 500 people waiting for Uber and taxi alone! They stopped answering the Uber requests over night it was so bad. As a mother traveling with two children I am appalled by how American Airlines has handled this. It may have started due to weather but this is all due to a lack of management, training and customer service. Never again. Credit card will be closed and I will never again give my money to the worst airline out there.  Worst experience ever we waited 3hr 23min they said because of “rain” but on American I have flown in rain tons of times and after rain stoped they deboarded the plane and said it was raining but clearly weather forecast says not raining.   Another horrible day traveling with AA. Staff has been nice but flight was delayed for 6 hours. Then once we finally got on the plane, AC didn’t work while we sat at the gate another 24 minutes. I am still sitting on the plane waiting to back away from the gate. This has been another major American Airlines blunder.  I have flown with American Airlines numerous times over the years. I am an Aviator Mastercard member and AA Advantage member but my experience with American Airlines over the past four days has completely changed my opinion of them. My flight home for the holidays was cancelled and they refused to return my baggage to me when I requested it immediately. I waited for my bags for two hours the night it was cancelled then was told to return the next morning. I went the next morning and requested my bag to be pulled, waited 6 hours and still no bag. Was told I’d be called once they found it. Heard nothing for three days then after calling around, I found out today my bag was sent to Omaha even though I never flew. Now I’m having to figure out how to get my baggage home to me without being lost again. This experience completely destroyed our holiday plans and the entire weekend. Throughout this whole experience it was impossible to get ANYONE from American to assist me in finding my baggage. The AA workers at the Charlotte baggage claim office were confrontational, unfriendly, insensitive and caused total chaos among all of the worried travelers. There were several other travelers in line beside me needing vital medications from their luggage and the staff showed no remorse, offering zero effort in trying to assist them. These people were told that this should be a “lesson” not to put medication in your checked bag!! I am so disappointed in the lack of assistance, communication and service that I had grown to expect from American Airlines. I don’t say this to be rude, I share this so that things can be addressed and changed so others don’t experience this in the future. Thank you.    Customer service is really bad! Takes 40 to 45 minutes to talk to the agent. Incredibly hard to receive refund. No phone to contact a refund team. Not gonna use this airline again.  This was one of the worst experiences of my life. I was going to travel alone to visit my dad in Houston. I am a young woman and was left alone 3 hours away from home or anyone I knew with no help from anyone. I get on the plane, by guessing where I was supposed to go because when I asked people that worked at the airport they would not help me. I get on the plane and the plane is sitting for 30 minutes before we finally go and the attendants are giving out directions in case of emergency. We got to the point where they turned the lights off and told us to turn our phones on airplane mode and we were about to take off. About 20 minutes later nothing happens and the pilot tells everyone there is a mechanical problem with the plane and that they were trying to fix it but couldn’t. We get off of the plane and the flight is cancelled. I am now in a place where I don’t know, alone, and have no where to go. They would not let me get my luggage that night and were claiming that it would get to my final destination eventually. I have been lied to saying that there was no “managers” there and that they had no one to get passengers bags, even though I expressed that my daily medicine is in my suitcase. I eventually find a hotel, but figure out that they put the reason for the plane saying it was cancelled was because of a “missing crew member” even though everyone on the flight heard exactly what the pilot said. If I did not have enough money for a hotel room, I would have not had anywhere to stay, and they locked us out of the airport. They are hiding mechanical errors in planes as “missing crew members” so they do not have to compensate for hotels. That is fraud. Please think twice before booking with American Airlines. \\xa0 \\xa0A disastrous experience. My recent encounter with American Airlines has left me utterly disappointed and frustrated. From start to finish, the experience was marred by a complete lack of care and professionalism, particularly exemplified by staff at the counter, whose rudeness was unparalleled. First and foremost, our flight was delayed not just once or twice, but a staggering five times. This not only disrupted my plans but also caused me to miss a crucial business meeting that I had traveled for. Despite explaining the urgency of my situation to the staff, he seemed indifferent and unapologetic, displaying a shocking level of disregard for customer concerns. To add insult to injury, the ordeal didn\\'t end there. Due to the repeated delays, I inevitably missed my return flight as well. In what should have been a straightforward journey, American Airlines managed to turn it into a logistical nightmare. What truly astounds me is the blatant apathy displayed by American Airlines towards their customers. Despite multiple instances of inconvenience and dissatisfaction, there was no semblance of empathy or effort to rectify the situation. It\\'s disheartening to see a company prioritize profits over the well-being and satisfaction of its patrons. In conclusion, my advice to anyone considering American Airlines is simple: stay away. The combination of abysmal customer service, frequent delays, and a lack of accountability make for an experience that is best avoided at all costs. Until significant improvements are made, I will be taking my business elsewhere, and I strongly urge others to do the same.   Completely awful airline. This is the only airline that I have horrible experiences with. The first time I had a horrible experience I figured it was a one off, this last time they canceled my flight last minute after delaying it three times. I had a jump on a random flight and pay a Uber driver almost $400 to drive me 2 1/2 hours from one airport home because I had to be home to my kids and work. As they did not give me options I had to figure this out myself then they completely lost my bag. It has been all over the US. I get different stories from every person I speak to. I’ve spoken to seven different people and they’ve all giving me different stories. When I reached out to American, they offered me a $25 flight credit. It was almost insulting after everything I had been through with this airline and all the hoops I had to jump through and they lost my bag to offer me $25 flight credit thinking I would ever fly with them again is horrible. I highly recommend even if it another airline is more expensive. It is way worth it. It is not worth going through what I went through and nobody that works for them will care.   Plane Maintenance issue made us turn around. Ok. Then we got in line to get new flights set up. Ok. Then we got word the plane or a plane would be ready at noon. Ok. Got back in line rebooked another set of flights. But still taking the noon flight to Charlotte. Ok. Then noon comes and goes and they announce no plane and will update us at 12:30. Not ok and unacceptable treatment of an entire plane full. Probably just flying out if Dayton. Either way used to look firmware to an American Airlines flight as you were treated Great!! Not the case in this instance.   Bad attitudes amongst staff, troubles getting flights to take off, and having consistently delayed flights. Arguably the worst experience I’ve ever had flying, ever.  The help centers are an absolute joke. They take an hour to help 2 people. By the time they reach you all of the potential connecting flights will have already left.   Worst experience ever. Our flight got delayed, missed the connection. Had to sleep at the airport because the hotel we were set up for was infested with bedbugs. The flight itself was OK for the money. But the delays and the service are very poor. We got rerouted the next day making a 1 stop flight to a 2 stop flight. Best part now we are trying to fly back, the same thing.  My flight was from London to Dallas and I have booked an economy class ticket. I got my seat in the middle rows, the seat size is very small compared to other airlines and leg space is horrible. Folks with height above 5\\'10\" sitting in these rows would be a nightmare. Coming to meals and snacks, I am a vegetarian and the items given for lunch were pathetic. The pasta was undercooked, tastes really bad and very limited options on the plate. Overall, very bad experience.   The worst airline I have ever used in my entire life. Cancelled flight and did not help rebook customers, did not pay for accommodations while we waiting for the “earliest flight they could put us on” that was 3 days later, and did not provide any sort of customer experience whatsoever. Disgusting airline and horrific management/customer service. Will never be flying American again.   The check in employee at American Airlines in Raleigh NC was one of the rudest experiences in my life. We approached the check in desk (my gf and I) where no one was present at first. A few minutes later this employee walked up and behind the counter, rudely exclaiming “so you wanna be first in line”. We were on standby a little confused about the process and we were hoping to see if our unassigned seats were available so we knew (hopefully) where we were going to sit. The American Airlines employee then continued to high five her co-worker completely ignoring us. She turned to us after a few minutes of waiting then stating that the computers were down, and that there was nothing else we can do. Shortly after she told my girlfriend to stand and wait at the front desk. She chit chatted more with her coworker about non-work related stuff. She then rudely stated “what else can I help you with!?” which made us very uncomfortable - so much so that we left to cool down. After looking at very expensive snack prices we came back to find a new line had formed at the gate desk. Overall we did not catch the flight, even though we were 1st and 2nd on the standby list. After we chose seats to wait, somehow another person jumped us both to 1st. I’m not sure, but I think she demoted our positions. 0 out of 5 stars for American, solely because of the staff unprofessionalism.   I purchased tickets through Priceline. I was flying from Albuquerque to Spokane and had a layover in Phoenix. For the carry on they don’t let you use duffle bags. They don’t tell you that on the website. The flight was fairly short so they didn’t offer beverages but they did provide beverages upon request. I was requesting water and coffee so I can’t speak on that plane’s beverage selection, I remember seeing someone requesting Trulys. The second flight was about 2hrs and they were pretty consistent about offering snacks and beverages. They had a nice selection of beverages for being a plane. The only thing that cost money was the adult beverages. I will admit when it comes to beverage selection my expectations aren’t high for planes, coffee and water. They had coffee, water, a couple sodas, and adult beverages. Both planes were comfortable for being planes mind you I’m a ~190lbs woman with medium build. Overall it was a good experience and I’d fly with them again.   Phoenix to Mexico City flight was actually good. Departed & arrived on-time. Purchasing food onboard was somehow complicated since you have to upload your credit card details in their app which I find unsafe, this is just me though. A slightly bigger meal could have been served instead of just a small pack of biscuit in this three-hour international flight.   I was on a school tour with about 28 kids in our group. We were touring Washington DC and we had a flight from DC to Charlotte, NC. Our flight was on time but then we had a delay because one of the bathrooms was not working and we sat on the plane for about an hour and then deplaned. We waited off the plane for another hour, and then we got back onto another plane. Again, we had a delay. We sat on the plane for another hour because they had to wait on the fuel. Our original flight was supposed to leave at 7.45 but Charlotte is a very short flight from DC. We got to Charlotte at 12.03 that night. To make things worse, flight attendants were rude and not assuring and they were not helpful to the situation. Never flying on this airline again and please never fly on American.  Extremely disappointed with the COVID protocols on American Airlines. They packed everyone in to full capacity with no respect to distance for passengers. The plane had clearly not been cleaned as the windows were full of smudges from old passengers and the seats were in whatever positions the previous passengers at used them. It appears they are more interested in making money then keeping their passengers safe. I flew Delta for the other end if this trip and they had spaced out seating that allowed passengers to remain safe distances from one another, as well as a huge cleaning crews that I personally saw go on and off the plane in between flights to disinfect. The plane was extremely clean. Hoping they can enlighten American Airlines on smarter protocols.   We\\'ve all heard the stories of how bad the airlines are: Southwest and Spirit #1 and 2 in that order. Well guess what? American is #3. In every capacity. From customer service, flight reliability, ease of service, AA rewards to ticket credits and so on. The customer service agents are rude and combative. When you ask to speak to a supervisor they tell you no and hang up on you.   Am a United Miles Member and unfortunately have to fly American for a more direct flight. American\\'s customer service is probably the worst I have experienced with a major airline- United is by far superior. Had to change my flight to a later time; the agent changed it but failed to re-ticket the reservation. I called this morning and received a call-back three hours later. The agent said that it would be ticketed. Still shows \"ticket pending\". Called again and received call back two hours later and was put on hold for 30 minutes - I hung up. Called a 3rd time and now my call back is 4 hours. Total incompetents working at American!   Booked my tickets 6 months in advance, 3 weeks before the flight I got a email from American Airlines saying my flight times were changed. I thought nothing of it until my return flight had a 4.5 hour layover. When I paid for the tickets I chose no more then an hour layover because I dont like sitting at an airport wasting time. So after the good flight was full they bumped me to a different flight to sell my tickets to someone else, seeing as I already paid .. what was I going to do. Last time flying with them for sure. Not to mention the flight boarding people were not nice at all.  As a disabled vet it’s a nightmare flying American. They have no disabled boarding, and you instead have to fight your way through a sea of rude people to get to your seat. In my case this meant a passenger in first class who wouldn’t move their leg from the aisle kicking my cane out of my hand, tripping me, and laughing as I fell on my face in the aisle. Not a single person including flight attendants bothered to help me get up, which is very difficult for me. Once I got to my seat a flight attendant took my cane and stowed it in the overhead about 10 rows behind me. During the flight I had to use the restroom and the flight attendant refused to get my cane for me so I could get to the restroom because it was too much of a hassle to get it from so many rows back, then told me I would have to wait until we arrived at our destination. This is not only rude and disrespectful, it’s discrimination. Flying is bad enough without flight attendants discriminating against and refusing to assist with accessibility for disabled passengers. American is an absolute joke of a company with the most worthless disgusting human beings working for them. If you’re disabled don’t bother trying to fly on American.   Boarded the plane with no issues. Mask was not covering nose so I was asked to bring it up so I did. Don\\'t really have an issue with the mask thing, just putting that out there. Sat down with wife and two children for our flight from Dallas to Denver. 5 minutes later as we are starting to move like any middle-aged man I\\'m out lke a light. Noise canceling headphones on sunglasses on hat down. Out! Probably because American Airlines stranded us in the airport overnight with to children from 11:45pm until 6am. So I am woke up to someone poking me so I turn to my wife and say yes? She was not the one poking me it was the flight attendant I could not her here that well so took headphones off and asked her what she was saying. So I promise you the next statement is true and not out of a movie. She said \" sir while you are sleeping your mask needs to cover your nose\" I apologized as I wasn\\'t aware it had slipped off my nose as I slept. She said this is the third time she had asked. Don\\'t remember the 2nd but none the less ok I get it. Don\\'t go back to sleep and focus on my mask. It looked as though they were having another issue with a passenger that could not be solved so they were turning the plane around for him. When we arrived they removed that passenger and then they asked me my wife and two children to gather our belongings. We politely complied. After stepping off the plane they said that our refusal to comply with the mask requirements is why we were asked to leave. Apparently the flight attendant told them a very different story. That we were deliberately disobeying the flight attendant. To which my children told the manager that she was not telling the truth. As I was sleeping this was news to me. So here we are. They booked on the next American Airlines flight which doesn\\'t make any sense. But just to clear the air I am not a anti masker and I am fully vaccinated as are my wife and two children (14 and 13). We started this journey in South Florida on a Wednesday at 4pm it is now 8 am on a Thursday and we are stuck in Dallas. This was supposed to be a 4 hour flight. It is sad that a flight attendant would have to lie to get what she needs done. A little kindness goes a long way.   Terrible. My family and I were forced to check our bags even though there was plenty of room in the overhead compartments for our carry ons, and our carry ons were within the size limit for the compartments. Once at the baggage claim, all of our bags eventually came out except for mine. We headed into the customer relations office to ask if they knew where my bag was, and the woman’s response was, “We’ve been waiting for you to come in here.” They then proceeded to show me that my bag had been completely shredded, and several items inside had been shredded as well. It was very obvious that they were not planning on going out of their way to show me my damaged bag or make up for the damages. I’m very disappointed with the customer service and the lack of awareness in today’s world. I will not be flying with American again.   Does American know how to run an airline? I\\'m skeptical now, after multiple flights home cancelled due to \"weather\" at the last second and with no help or sympathy by employees. Really it should not take me sleuthing on the internet to find creative ways home. This is the third time last 4 flights with AA that I\\'ve faced long delays or cancellations. Time to reconsider flying.  I just wanted to give a great shout out to crew on flight 777 Aug 15. We were running late for our flight! We got on plane because the pilot waited a few seconds! He is the Best! We had the best crew that was so loving and caring! We could only ever hope that you are the crew in the future! Yall are so great at your jobs! Much appreciation!   Horrible Customer service, and just a horrible airline to fly. The staff don’t help and they won’t let you switch flights even when they aren’t full, or when you have to pay extra. Do not fly American.   We were on flight into Dallas then on to Nashville. Storms were present so we have red for an hour then diverted to Houston for refueling. So we missed our connecting float and arrived back at Dallas at midnight. Everyone has to stand in line to rebook and wait time on phone is 2-3 hours. So at 12:30am. They close all customer service desks even with at least 100 people in line. Dallas airport has zero options for food or drink at this time except vending machines that work some of the time. So they book us on a 9 PM flight tonight. So we book another flight thru another airline but you can’t get your baggage until security comes in at 3am. If I could do negative rating I would. I will say the crew on the plane was friendly.   I am visiting in Minnesota returning on Halloween, October 31 2021 on a 6.37am direct flight to Charlotte (arrives in Charlotte at 10.20am). I get up early in preparation of driving the 7 miles from my hotel to the airport, returning rental car etc. I get an email at 2.59am stating that my flight has been cancelled and they have rebooked/held my spot on a flight the next day that leaves at 6.22 pm and arrives in Charlotte at 11.49pm which is simply not acceptable. Who pays for another night in a hotel? A rental car for a day? Meals? I quickly jump on a computer and see that an American Airline flight direct to Charlotte leaves at 5.00am and has seats available. The problem is I will not make this flight by 20 to 30 minutes assuming security, drive etc. goes flawlessly. This is highly disturbing when you are informed at the airport that they knew about these cancellation the night before. Why would this 5am flight have seats open? Surely someone along with myself would have grabbed this opportunity. I rush to airport as you cannot get through to the AA Customer Service via telephone. Another cancelled flight passenger told me at the airport that they told him it would take 4 hours to get through. I start a new job the next day (this can be verified if necessary) and have to get home. So at the airport naturally there are long lines for AA departures. The employees of AA are obviously instructed to take passengers for flights that are not cancelled so we are in a line that is manned by one employee and each person takes at least 10 minutes - it would take several hours to talk with someone. AA is simply letting us know that we are not important and basically \"screwed\". I have no choice but to book with another airline. I used miles for my flight so doling out $450 for the flight is irritating. The bag charge was a wash as I assume I get reimbursed for that with AA and my miles. The reason above that I have not flown with AA for so long is two fold. My last trip was to be to San Francisco but AA in their ultimate profit drive changes that flight so my vacation would be cut a day as I would have arrived over 24 hours later. Before that I cancelled the AA Miles card since I had issues. I get that a company needs to make profit but complete disregard for customers is not a long term profitable solution. I often wonder if all the flight attendants reports on passenger behaviors is partly a result of the frustrating experience that flying has become. I am writing this after returning home on Halloween day at 5.00pm. The AA website when using anything like the chat is erroring out, not flights however. Maybe it is overloaded or simply a low priority. It is insulting to see AA has articles nationally in the paper attributing over 700 flight cancellations Halloween weekend to weather in Fort Worth/Dallas and some staffing issues. Delta did not have any cancellations, just delays so we know AA has other issues besides weather they are trying to keep covered up. One has to wonder if any delays at one airport will set off a cascade of cancellations with AA. I am out over $450 from my pocket due to AA promising a service and not delivering. The FAA needs to start implementing mandatory rules regarding flight cancellations and restitution to paying customers. At a minimum I should get a $450 voucher for flight or flights with AA as well as everything back from cancelled flight.  We boarded the flight and when everyone was seated, they said get your bags and get down there is a change in flight. We got down and they don\\'t even know what our new gate will be. They eventually got us a new gate number. We got to the new gate and they promised that the flight was here and they are just cleaning it and will be boarding in 5 minutes. Then after about 30 minutes they announce that the flight needed repairs. And after that no more updates for about an hour and we are sitting here with no idea of what is happening. Customer support is getting rude and people are just frustrated. I have heard a lot of bad things about American Airlines but I didn\\'t know it was this bad. This is my second time of flying with them and I know this will be my last. If you have other options don\\'t choose American airlines, they are a total failure to humanity.  This is related to our flight March 14th - it was just cancelled, all other flights for Lauderdale still went and booking was made for the next evening 8.45pm. We missed our cruise. We had booked through the cruise so we would get better service and coordination. Our baggage went the same day to Fort Lauderdale and we couldn\\'t. I was hoping they would coordinate and make sure we could get on the next flight and not miss our cruise. Many of their staff were rude, inconsiderate and no common courtesy of being nice.  3-hour delay because they can\\'t find anyone to fly the planes. What a joke of an airline. How hard is it to find pilots for your fleet? Public transport on the ground has fewer issues.  Incompetent and rude staff. Since May we\\'ve had nothing but problems flying with this Airline. If it is not cancelled flights, it is vouchers not being given to all customers. The last event in August 11th was our 2nd luggage never made it up the belt. Apparently one of their employees wanted to steal it until they realized there was nothing but door handles and shoes in it. We went to put a claim and the supervisor on the 1p.m. shift name Ileana screamed that she wouldn\\'t be putting bag claims to do the QR code. This was impossible to do on the site and I\\'ve been over 9 days trying to get someone to help. Now they called to say they will send my luggage to Texas. Useless, rude, overprices thieves.   The aircraft itself is not uncomfortable - I am used to Delta but have flown with a few other airlines and this one was fine. The flight attendants were very nice. What I am super disappointed and annoyed about is that my flight from Cozumel to Miami was delayed so I missed my flight. Customs in Miami only had like 3 lanes open and both customs and security were severely backed up. I was not acting entitled or asking to skip the line, but whenever I did have a question for the TSA agents (or any employee in that area, they might not all have been TSA) either ignored me or responded very rudely. They first laughed in my face and said that everyone still has to go through security, when I asked if he recommended a speedier line. I was not trying to bypass security, just save time, which I think is reasonable. I went to ask another man for directions and he shook his head. I was starting to get lost, went to ask another woman a question and she pointed me the wrong way and then was rude when I tried to explain that that wasn\\'t what I meant. So I missed my flight, whatever.  I sucked it up and continued through security while trying to find a new flight back home to Nashville. On the AA app, which had my boarding pass, it said my flight had been delayed. So I ended up still walking to the gate, where the lady behind the counter ignored me for a solid five minutes. I know her job is hard and she was busy, but it was humiliating. When she finally looked up, I asked if they were still boarding - since, as I said, the app showed a delay that made me believe I could still make it. She quickly muttered \"it left\" and went back to her work. So I go get a coffee and empanada from the Cuban cafe to make myself feel better - highly recommend. I ran into a super nice flight attendant who helped me figure out how to find customer service. I wish I had gotten her name, she was so sweet and helpful and patient. I headed to customer service because neither the app nor the website reflected that I had missed my flight - as I said, it showed \"delayed\". So I couldn\\'t figure out how to switch to a later one and wanted in-person help rather than talking to a machine on the phone. That\\'s reasonable. The customer service line was insane. Two desks opened at first, eventually a third person showed up. I waited in line for two hours, easily. With an insane stroke of luck, I ended up with a man who was very kind and efficient. He was able to get me a straight flight back home instead of some insane connecting flight out of Fort Worth at 12AM. I had just spent all day at the Miami airport being humiliated by many of the staff. I\\'m glad it ended on a good note (even though my straight flight was also delayed) Overall, not happy with American Airlines or the Miami airport staff.  Wichita to Indianapolis via Dallas. Airline communication was awful on the ground. They needed more staff to help handle everything properly. After flight got delayed several times resulting in a total of over 5 and a half hours, the crew moved everyone to a different gate that was about half a mile away and told everyone to wait for more info at 11:30 pm on a flight that was supposed to leave at 6:00 pm. After finally getting off the ground at 12:15 am, turbulence prevented drink service for half of the plane the rest of the 2+ hour flight. Plane seating was surprisingly cramped where I could not straighten my legs out, which is unfortunate because I was hoping I could at least get some rest on the plane. Most of the crew was actually friendly, which is sad because the overall situation seems to be a recurring symptom of a company that does not care about their workers or customers. It would have actually been two hours faster to drive from Wichita to Indianapolis.   I had a flight July 31st 9.00 am, flight was canceled, I booked again Aug 1st, they canceled again and due to a family emergency I have to be in Pensacola. I call them, the first time was two hours and thirty six minutes, second time I call them was over four hours, I am still waiting for them to answer my call, because no other way to get hold of them.   Over promise and under delivered. Cost me a day with my family. As well as $60 because I had to pay for the taxi. They \"forgot\" to give me a taxi voucher with my hotel and food voucher. Then told me they wouldn\\'t give me my money. That I should contact them via website. Asked if they could at least upgrade my seat for the inconvenience. No, wouldn\\'t do that either. Worst airline ever.   Who cancels an 8.20 am flight and notifies you at 12.30 by text while you are deep asleep (8 hours before the flight) and moves the flight up to 6.30 am the same day? Of course we missed that flight. To add insult to injury, the non-stop became a red-eye with a 4 hour layover in ORD. The trip to PHL was changed from business class to economy with our two seats scattered in the wind. Can’t even fly together. Extra hotel charges, baggage fees for economy status, extra transportation costs plus an unexpected extra day of travel. Unacceptable treatment and unreasonable accommodation from AA.   American has quite simply taken the throne as the worst airline imaginable. Where do I even start? We board in Phoenix, AZ in June when it is 110 degrees outside and the plane is a literal sauna. Apparently the ac “wasn’t connected”. We then sit on the tarmac for an extra 25-30 minutes sweating profusely in the most uncomfortable situation. In the air, the outstandingly horrible display of an airline continued. I paid $40 for Wifi for the flight to watch the Us open golf tournament and in the least surprising news of the century - the wifi was broken for more than 75% of the flight. The cherry on top was the flight attendants ridiculous behavior. When asking for garbage I handed the man my sprite can and the cup. He only grabbed the can and the cup spilled on a passenger at the end of the row. They are having an exclusive discount on a Mastercard for 70,000 miles? What a joke. The attendants were loud on the speaker talking for at least 20 minutes trying to push this deal before the end of the month. Grand finale? They had interns on the flight deck at JFK and they moved the plane to far forward. We sat at the gate for 45 minutes before being able to get off the plane at 12 in the morning. If you offered me free flights for life on American I would say “no thank you” disgusting display of professionalism- worst airline imaginable. Should definitely take your business elsewhere   Brought my 2 year old with me. 2 years old and up require masks due to covid per CDC. She kept it on in the airport and when boarding. But when we sat in our seats, which was just our family, she removed the mask to eat goldfish sporadically. The flight attendant told me that she had to wear a mask. I apologized and said she had been eating and placed it on. The next time the flight attendant came by she said she needs to wear it even though my daughter was actively eating at the time which I told her. She said well it really should stay on and just be pulled up and down. On a 2 year old? Be realistic. However, what really was upsetting was that adults around us had their masks partially down while eating and there was another child next to our aisle that was at least 3 that never had a mask on at any point. She didn’t have it on during the flight or when they left and the flight attendant never commented. I think that it would be easier to tolerate this lady’s unrealistic standards, if she held everyone to them and not just my child. Other staff were completely fine.   We are so angry and disappointed with American Airlines. We spent $2000 on our tickets and had to cancel due to travelling restrictions from covid. This airline is a fraud and basically stole our money from us. We asked for a refund or better yet even a credit to use to be able to travel again. However they claim our tickets were already discounted and they were unable to give us either. Our initial tickets we purchased were half this amount but the airline changed the flight and we rebooked, so for them to say we got these at a discounted rate is a cop out and a lie. Avoid American Airlines at all costs. I can honestly say we won’t be flying with them anymore.   Salt Lake City to Harrisburg. American Airlines doesn\\'t care about their customers.  To put this into perspective, my wife, 6.5 months pregnant at the time of her flight, was traveling with our two year old sick daughter. American Airlines did her the service of delaying her flight, canceling another, assigning her and my daughter to seats that weren\\'t together (despite having paid for seats ahead of time so they could be together) and ultimately putting her at a destination that was 2.5 hours away from where her final destination should have been. This obviously led to an extremely terrible and stressful travel day. She asked multiple employees if she would be able to get refunded for her trip and all of them claimed that it would definitely be possible, especially because she never made it to her final destination. After battling it through with the company for over a month now, they continue to claim that there is nothing they can do to refund her for the trip. But, \"She can take solace in the fact that the employees of the company are so nice.\" Terrible company. Terrible service. Won\\'t be flying with them any more in the future.   American Airlines needs to step up their game. Domestic aircrafts are not equipped with passenger’s monitor/entertainment. It becomes torture to sit in the cabin during flights and especially delays (which happen not infrequently)    AA damaged my bag on 11 May when I arrived in Indianapolis from Austin, Texas. I retrieved my bag from the carousel and noticed it was busted on top. I took it to the customer service desk and they took my bag and gave me a case number along with a phone number to call after a week if no one had contacted me. I waited almost two weeks before calling. I spoke with a Rep about my bag replacement and they kept asking me to provide a receipt of purchase for a bag I bought over 9 months ago and to take a picture of the bag that was turned in to customer service. Then I was told someone from AA would reach out to me. Need I remind you my bag was damaged on 11 May and I have yet to receive a call or replacement bag since then.   The rep at desk (STL) arguing I did not pay baggage ahead of time. I did pay ahead of time. After 5 minutes or so she have info to another rep and she finally found the receipt (I had shown her receipt on my phone) and it still took about 10 more minutes to find and approve I had paid it. First rep was very rude. The second one was very nice. Also, my seat was changed I had picked a month before in Charlotte. Why would they change my seat and put a random person in there on flights? I was flying with my granddaughter and daughter. The American reps in Panama City, Fl and Washington DC were great. Being half of the stops were with very unhelpful or rude employees, I will try and never use American.   I will not recommend to travel through American Airlines to anyone. My flight to Belize was canceled causing us to miss a day in Belize. When I call customer service regarding this matter, to see if they had something earlier or closer to our expected arrival time to Belize (12 noon), the guy was rude, unprofessional, and not helpful. Saying I can just cancel the flight. Although they had already canceled. Very insensitive. Too add his solution to the problem was scheduled for a flight the next day. Meaning we would have missed 2 days in Belize instead of the one day. Which was already inconvenient. So we ending up taking the later flight which cost us money. And there is more. We arrived back to the states and what was supposed to be a layover turned into a delayed flight. We paid for parking at the airport and will now be charged additional fees. And I will probably miss my connecting flight via Delta because of this delay.  They couldn\\'t even offer me anything after ruining our trip. I will rate them ZERO.  Very poor service.   Without a doubt the worst airline experience I have ever experienced. 0/10 would never recommend to a friend, in fact would actively suggest taking any other airline. Misplaced our luggage (2 bags) in transit, refused to deliver same night. Next morning delivered 1 bag and left the second in office for some reason. After which proved impossible to contact to verify second delivery. Called office over 30 times, only one of which was picked up and then almost immediately hung up on. Incredibly frustrating and totally unhelpful.   Pensacola  to South Bend via Charlotte. I booked a trip to Pensacola with my niece who was turning 18. I wanted to spend time with her prior to her going to college! Didn’t think our time would be spent in airports or on the plane. On the way there we had a connecting flight to Dallas which then took us to Pensacola. We ran into flight delays, flight cancellations, missed flights, to not getting on standby flights! It was a mess to put it lightly. South Bend people were not helpful and were a bit rude. When we got to Dallas, staff was extremely unhelpful and rude. She told me that she was in the middle of something and I would have to go elsewhere. The other staff were extremely helpful and they should lead a training on customer service. Toni who worked 33d on 2-13-2020 was extremely nice as well. The rest of the workers should be fired. After spending 15 hours in airports and on a plane I didn’t have much energy to complain so I settled for a standby flight for in the morning which we didn’t catch. We ended up catching the mid afternoon flight so we lost a day and 1/2 of our vacation. On the way home our flight was delayed due to the flight crew not having enough hours so instead of 7:27 take off it was 7:50. We get to Charlotte however, our plan needed maintenance so there was yet another delay. They change us to a different plane which also needed maintenance so we got switched to a 3rd plane. This plane was from the 70’s and I prayed we would make it to South Bend. We did but never again will I fly American Airlines. I wasn’t going to write a review but when I heard other people’s stories waiting at the airport I knew my concerns were valid. Please do yourself a favor and book with a different airline!  Some times people just make a review to complain about a situation but I am writing this review to give kudos to an amazing selfless flight attendant who went out of her way to help me. I know she went out of her way because she mentioned that she was in a hurry to get to the other side of the airport to her assigned gate. That speaks volumes that she took the time to help me. I would have been stuck at the airport all night possibly all weekend if it wasn\\'t for her willingness to help me and find me another flight. I waited over 12 hours at the airport. With no guidance or help my flight continued to get delayed. I finally had enough of sitting at the airport and not being able to get to my dentation which was originally Washington DC. I went to a very helpful and kind flight attendant explained to her that I am in desperate need of getting as closet to Richmond VA as possible she found a resolution rerouting my flight to Raleigh NC.   Delays. Took me 11 hours. I decided to fly American after not doing so for years because I wanted a nicer flight. Dumb idea. Late, delays but most importantly arrogant personnel. Flat affect. No customer service. Never again. You have lost my business forever!   I booked tickets to have the airline change them 5 times, not me to then only leave a small window to get to my connecting flight! Then there was delays from the get go, to then being at a standstill in theO Hare to get to our gate! We had our connecting flight to Alabama a few gates down. I ran to our gate but had my husband wait for my check bag! We were traveling with friends they got on the plane, but when the attendant called the pilot stating we were delayed and four of us were traveling the Pilot refused to wait for us! As we got our bag the flight was then closed as we sat there and the plane was still there and could not get on, we ended up having to fly to DC then to Alabama a total of 8 hours more to get to our destination. It was a nightmare, and I will never fly this airline again. We had a full day of vacation that we could not enjoy due to this experience. The attendant was not nice at all at O Hare, I will again never fly with this airline.  I used to hold American Airlines in high regard. No more. They have slipped severely the past few years on service. I traveled from Lake Charles to DFW for my connecting flight to Chicago O\\'Hare to see my daughter and grandson for the first time in 4 years. I bought a first class ticket and wheel chair assistance because I am disabled. DFW had flights backed up coming into the airport. They claimed it was weather related. Wasn\\'t even raining when I arrived. My assistant for my wheelchair tried his best to get me to my connecting flight on time. We had 20 minutes to get 30 minutes across the terminals to my gate. Plane left without me. No flights available until the next morning. I had to rebook. I expected a hotel and meal voucher. They were handing them out like candy for other flights. But because they claimed it was weather, management refused to give me a voucher. You would think they would should some accommodation because I bought an expensive first class ticket. Not to mention, I brought up ADA laws and reasonably accommodation for disability. Both staff were nasty rude people and have no business in management. Yes, I lost my temper and called them both a name after they pushed me to my limits. So here I am right now trying to sleep in a chair at my gate at the airport for my flight that\\'s eight hours from now without any dinner or accomodations. I should be in Chicago right now, but American Airlines left me stranded at DFW and refused to make it right. The first time I buy a first class ticket and I am treated like trash.   Missed second flight because when we landed there was another plane in our terminal. American refused to get us a hotel because they blamed the weather even though it was their fault. Forced my toddler and pregnant wife to spend the night in the airport  Do not fly American. They stranded me in Jackson MS because they felt that ticket sales on my return flight were too low. They then “lost” my flight reservation in New Orleans and made me purchase another ticket at a premium price or risk getting stranded again. I had to purchase 2 tickets for the same flight. They will not refund the cost of the 2nd ticket.   Worst experience ever. Booked my trip 3 times for British airways, to fly for a memorial. In August I received an email advising me my direct flight, which I had booked business class was canceled. So I had to book using American Airlines. Arrived 3 hour early with all my documents. Checked in and at the final step was told we had to download an app and complete a questionnaire. Asked for help, none given and was asked to step out of line. Completed the app, stood back in line and at second check in. Now my Covid test which didn’t have my name on it, but had to be opened through facial recognition, wasn’t good enough. Asked for a supervisor and wasn’t allowed to speak with one. Told again to step out of line. As we walked away, I managed to bring up my name. I returned to the same “lady” who purposely ignored me, calling on others. When I approached her, she told me to wait in the now much longer line. As we finally made it to the ticket window, we were told we had missed the baggage times and now had missed our flights and because it’s a flight through British airways, they couldn’t book us either. 45 min of being on hold, rebooked flights which cost $1500, more and back to economy seat (which business was a splurge since my mom died). Sent emails upon my return and received a callus response to the effect of sorry your responsible for documents that you didn’t have. Well I did have them, and much like the ticket person, you didn’t take the time to listen   Worst airline ever! Worst customer service ever. Kept us sitting in airport on a return flight from Memphis for 6 hours promising that another flight was coming, then cancelled us. Then, after servicing most of the passengers, they simply told us they ran out of vouchers, and we were on our own. They admitted responsibility but said, in effect, too bad. After going it on our own, they first fought the reimbursement, but then reimbursed some of my group. Still, after nearly 2 months of waiting, I have not received my reimbursement for food, hotel, and taxi. Simply the worst customer relations I have ever seen in my life. Please don\\'t fly American Airlines!   Well, let’s start off with the fact that I’m going to leave COVID completely out of this. Second of all, in terms of the seats and on board lavatories, you could tell this was an old plane. However, the ground experience at Terminal B at PHL was pleasant, though connecting from F from and earlier flight is a whole other story. Getting through Terminal B at to the Taxis at BOS was a breeze, and the flight departed and left on time. Also, the flight crew were nice enough!   My flight was originally scheduled at 10.25pm. Then the flight time kept on changing for 4 times, the gate got changed. No one explained the reason for this change. If something like this happens, they need to make people aware of the reasoning behind it. Everything was driving me crazy.   Phoenix to London with a very short layover in Dallas. I was really stressed about the short connection time. I approached the gate attendant and asked her if she could find me a seat closer to the front. She ignored my question and said “your roller bag cannot fly!”. I always fly with this roller bag. The bag was indeed about an inch too tall, but she would not budge. She said it would be $186 to check it. Absolutely unbelievable. I asked for a supervisor, and the sup, was even more insulting. Her explanation was “it’s a business!” I ended up having to ditch the roller bag and some clothes to pack my stuff in a smaller bag I purchased. They only care about money. They couldn’t care less about your experience.   Booked a flight for a daughters wedding. Had a medical emergency. Was in emergency hospital for 7 hours. Doctor recommended no travel. (Copy of letter was sent to AA at their request). AA refused to refund flight. Competition for flight down was on Alaska Airlines. They made a refund immediately. The cost of the ticket for AA was also about 60% more than Alaska Airlines. Had to book on AA for 1/2 the trip due to scheduling. Highly recommend Alaska Airlines, and NOT American Airlines. I am 82 years old  Do not fly American Airlines. They have no social distancing and will pack flights so that every seat is occupied. My trip was a disaster to say the least, my flight was delayed, with no communication from flight crew. I missed my connecting flight so they placed me on another flight, in another airport. No transportation service was offered. And they refused to remove my check-ins off the original flight, so my luggage went to another state for 24 hours while I headed to my destination. Baggage claim staff was very rude and had zero compassion for where my bag was and how it was going to get to me, knowing there were medications for my children in those bags. Once I did receive my bags, 24 hours in total it took to receive, the wheels on my luggage had been broken off. When I reached out to the baggage claim staff they said there was nothing they could do and refused to file a claim. Never again will I fly American Airlines. JetBlue is a great alternative if you are looking to fly.   I last flew international with American August of 2019, and I should have taken that hint the first time. The seats on this flight are tiny and so uncomfortable, they overbook the flight and offer travel vouchers but never take people up on their vouchers if they offer to switch flights. When i asked about seat upgrades, I was told it would be $3000 on top of my $2000 ticket to upgrade from main cabin to premium economy. That was an absolutely ridiculous price. Every international trip I have had with AA to or from Japan back to the United States has been less than ideal, and uncomfortable. The wifi on this flight was unresponsive for the first two to three hours, which was another frustration in and of itself. If you have the choice of flying through JAL, even if you book with the American Airlines site, take It. It is worth every inconvenience to get on a JAL flight opposed to an AA flight. Will never fly with them internationally again, especially at such a ridiculous price point.   I am an Active Duty Soldier and have never been so disrespected in my life. I flew from Atlanta to Dallas to pick up my son for the Summer. Our flight from Dallas back to Atlanta was suppose to departed at 1237 however, the flight kept getting delayed. I asked why the flight kept getting delayed and they said staffing. Around 1900 (almost 7 hours later) they cancelled the flight and lied and said it was because of weather. I asked for a hotel and food voucher and was told the flight was cancelled because of weather and that\\'s not American Airlines fault so they won\\'t give a voucher for anything. I explained to them I was told numerous times the flight was delayed because of staffing and they said I was lying. I asked to speak to a manger and she came and stated, \"I will not talk to anyone on the Atlanta flight\" and called the police. I asked to retrieve my son\\'s bag and they said no I couldn\\'t get the bag because it\\'s too much work on the ground crew to give everyone their bags. I was rebooted on a flight for 1921 (7:21pm) the next day. I asked what am I supposed to do with my son in the airport for over 24 hours with none of our stuff and a staff member told me to be a better father. American Airlines refused to compensate the passengers for canceling the flight because they didn\\'t have the staff for flight and lied and said it was cancelled because of weather. I spent so much money on feeding me and son (bored and tired of being in the airport) and had to spend $123 on a minute suite for 8 hours so my son felt safe while we slept. This is ridiculous and worse airline and customer service I ever experience. I understand things happen but assume responsibility and don\\'t make your paying customer suffer. I will never purchase my own American Airline ticket.   Where do I begin with how much of a bad experience I had? It couldn\\'t find my record locator, so an agent had to help me and she was very rude to me about it. She didn\\'t want me to select the choices (are you on an active military duty?) and selected all no for herself despite me wanting accommodations. They are bad with delays, the weather where I\\'m traveling through didn\\'t had any storms, yet I had to experience a 3 hour delay twice. Their handling of delay baggage is awful. They left my bag at Dallas. They gave sun country the responsibility to hold my bag for some reason instead of delivering it to me with my address in their profile. Had to waste time, gas, and parking fees to pick it up. They give out cheap price tickets sometimes but it\\'s not worth it \\xa0Every experience with this airline is terrible, but this was an especially bad experience. As usual, the dirty, cramped cabins are uncomfortable but expensive. The flight was delayed due to over-booking flights in Denver. They claimed weather, something entirely not backed up by their own flight tracker and the National Weather Service. Naturally, this is making me miss my connecting flight. I will gladly never fly this airline again. They are simply the worst airline.    It is sickening how customers are being treated by American Airlines on both travel days: 7.19.24 and 7.25.24. They have had nothing but unexplained delays on their end which has caused many passengers to miss their connecting flights. The rescheduled flights are then being delayed several hours at a time. After waiting in the customer service line for almost an hour the representative was rude and unhelpful. After reminding her of what a nightmare it has been for the last day of traveling with American Airlines she said \"We can give you $10 meal vouchers for each person in your party but not sure what you are going to find open.\" How does this help in any type of way? We received $10 vouchers after waiting for 5 hours on an already rescheduled flight, vouchers we will not even be able to use. I understand that technical issues happen and also understand that safety should remain the priority. However, the customer service and lack of empathy received by the representatives at Charlotte, NC American Airlines on 7.25.24 is something we will never forget. So many other passengers I have been chatting with have horror stories with them as well. So incredibly disappointed with the service and experiences we had with American Airlines - never again will we ever fly with them. Also please note that on our initial travel day of 7.19.24 from Charlotte, NC to Turks and Caicos- we had the most unprofessional flight attendants.   Mellisa from American Airlines is the one who saved a summer vacation for her diligent and quick efforts to save our flight which was cancelled at the last minute. She’s the hero to 3 kids who will have a blast and will experience memories that will last a lifetime. That’s sometimes all it takes. Doing the part that we’re meant to do and doing it with heart. She was on the check in counter 7/20-2023 at 6am.   I will never again spend any money with American Airlines. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had. I have flown many times and have had delays in the past but American Airlines takes zero responsibility for delays which result in missed flights. Their customer service is horrible and they treat their customers as if they don’t care if you ever fly with them again, which I will not.   American Airlines are the worst I have ever dealt with. Due to their fault I am stuck at JFK airport for 9 hours (which has now taken my journey time to around 24 hours). No one wants to help. I was offered a meal voucher for $24 dollars, a bottle of water at this airport is more than $5. It’s actually laughable. I asked if I could use the lounge so I could be more comfortable, not an option apparently. I asked if I could be upgraded so that I might have a chance to sleep on the plane, not available. So they have left me here to sit in an uncomfortable airport chair for 9 hours with about enough meal vouchers to get an overpriced bottle of water and a sandwich. AA are a joke and they do not care about their customers.  We had an amazing experience flying American from Detroit to Auckland, via Dallas, this December. Everything was strictly on time, we arrived almost 40 minutes early in Auckland, and the flight was so calm that I could not believe it. Moreover, for whatever reason, the plane was only half full, so we both had we extra seats to sleep a bit and landed in Auckland fresh and ready to explore. The crew was professional, the food was ok, the flight was perfect, nothing to complain. Thanks to the excellent crew that day.   I booked a trip for a long weekend with my son. They screwed up my reservation, lost my son’s reservation, hours on hold with customer service, had to buy another ticket to get my son to NC. Not even sure he has a reservation for our flight home. On hold with customer service for 4 hours yesterday only to be told I can only take care of it at the airport. Horrible experience!   American Advantage member with 48K miles. First attempt to fly, arrive early and online and kiosk to bag check are both down. have to wait in line, arrive at agent at 10:00 for a 11:00 flight. she is typing for a long time, then says \"its !0:01, you will have to fly standby tomorrow\". After a discussion with manager as well. agent issues standby boarding pass (issues no notes or record number to reference so their is no trail) and we leave. The next morning, arrive early again. kiosk is working and check bag, go to drop-off bag and clears again. mistakenly, ask for a manager for the previous days experience and to get a confirmed seat. Manager rolls out and pecks around on the computer and then says \"uhhhh, I don\\'t like the look of your passport, it looks too old and used\".  This was not a problem before. Goes and gets his manager, and she comes over after pow wowing with her cronies and says in a rude tone \" you\\'re not flying today\". 5 TSA agents said the passport looked fine and we spoke up, they all get together and say don\\'t get so close and call the police. We go to TSA Immigration office and confirm again, no problem with the passport. We return to the ticket area and there are 6 police officers waiting. We speak to them, they also agree we are not wrong, but say no flying today and we leave. When we ask for a refund then for 2 flights, bag fees paid two times, they just say call American Airlines number. (Which if you have tried, you wait 2-4 hours for a callback these days). They also cancelled the flight, and sure they\\'re are no notes again so probably will not get any money back.   I have flown many airlines and American is by far the WORST! We’re in the middle of a pandemic and while other airlines are leaving a seat between passengers, American is only worried about making an extra buck and is running all flights completely full!  The flight staff are the most disrespectful I’ve experienced and all 4 flights I’ve been on with them this past week we’re awful. Will not recommend to anyone I know and most certainly won’t be flying with them.   Never again will I fly with American Airlines. Stuck in CLT Airport for 12 hours, waited 2 hours for customer service, waited 9 hours to pick up my luggage all because of canceled flights. They were not helpful when trying to adjust flights, and they would not help with hotel rooms. Terrible customer service throughout the entire process. I have had issues every time I have flown with American Airlines. Never again will I fly with them until these issues are under control.   I will never fly with them again. I was the last to enter the flight so they decided to take my cabin bag as a checked bag, they damaged it and then they claimed it was previously damaged before and refused to write a luggage claim for me. My worst ever flight experience. The guy at their SFO airport office was extremely rude and he accused me that I accidentally damaged my bag to make them pay. What a disgrace!   Absolutely horrible customer service. They bumped me off my flight and pushed it to one 12 hours later. I am missing an extremely important meeting. No apology. No compensation. I have now been on the phone with their customer service for 2 hours trying to add my new flight miles to my AA advantage, they keep transferring and telling me they are getting an error message. I have logged into my aa advantage account 3 times since being on the phone with them to check account number and the my name. They have wasted 14 hours of my time without so much as an apology. Horrendous company. Should be dissolved.   Prior to the flight i told them we needed two wheelchairs to assist with people with disabilities. We check in and sat in the section to wait for the wheel chair people to come and take us to the gate. That was exactly what it was a wait - they never showed up. So we take a walk to the gate and we see 3 ladies with 3 wheel chairs sitting and gossiping/laughing. Hire people that want to work and not play on the job. That was very disrespectful. When we arrived to gate 29 walking up they announced it was there final boarding call so if we would have sat and waited any longer we would have missed our flight. Its a shame that we pay for flight tickets to travel and have to pay for a bag. We should be allowed at least 1 bag with your ticket.   My husband and my flight was delayed multiple times, then they gave away our tickets after we waited 5 hours to people on standby. We are now stuck in Philadelphia with no flight home.  I booked a trip to Guatemala for my boyfriend and me months ago. When i booked the flight I carefully chose our seat assignments because my boyfriend has back issues. Two days before our flight, I went on the American Airlines website to make sure our flight status was good. Once on the site, I saw that our seat assignments had disappeared. Panicked, I clicked to see what was left and there is nothing, one middle seat in the back of the plane. I carefully chose a seat with leg room in the aisle for my boyfriend because he will need to get up frequently. I called American airlines and waited on hold for 90 mins on a workday two days before my trip. They never gave a time estimate for hold or an option for a call back. I finally reached a representative who told me that an agent had made a change in the flight and had failed to reassign the seats I\\'d chosen. I asked why no one emailed me, the representative claimed American had sent an email to my boyfriend....that made no sense. I booked the flights, I had all of the confirmations and ticket info. I demanded to be given seats at no additional cost. The representative asked me to wait on hold, then disconnected me. Unlike other airlines, the representative had not asked for my contact information should we be disconnected. She likely did it on purpose because she didn\\'t want to deal with American Airlines mistake. I am not on hold for my second hour when I have a million things to do to prepare for this trip. NEVER FLYING WITH THEM AGAIN.   Last October and 2-2-21 I cancelled flights. I have spent many hours on the phone (got hung up on just this morning) as well as many emails (25 or 30) with customer relations trying to receive a voucher for a cancelled flights to Jamaica and Allentown, PA. Customer relations says \"check your email spam\" which I do. At least 40 times I have requested that info via phone and email How hard can it be? I wish someone there would get their act together. BTW when I asked to speak with a manager this morning, AA hung up. If I didn\\'t have a $636.39 credit, I would be thoroughly finished with AA  New York to Indianapolis. I’m a concierge key member. I had a 6pm Delta flight out of LGA, but tried to get an earlier aa flight out of JFK. I showed up and I was at the gate 13 min prior to departure time. The rule is door closes 10 min before departure. The plane had already pushed back. The gate team tried to explain that their policy is to close 15 min early vs AAs standard. Given that the flight had pushed back, even their statement seems unbelievable. I am a silver on Delta and they called me when I was running late in Philly. Similar situation. Exhausted with AA. Service has massively slipped.   We landed in Dallas and the guy getting our valet bags off the plane was extremely rude. He told me “bad mouth me and then your bag is last that’s karma” now I’ve worked in customer service before and that is most definitely something you don’t tell someone.   Most of my grievances are specifically with the Charlotte/Douglas Airport American Airlines employees. The outward bound trip had almost a 3 hour delay getting on our connection flight from there to Nashville ... this was after the first long leg flight from Germany to Charlotte, so we already had a 3 hour layover as we had to customs in NC and collect our bag and bring it for drop off to our connection flight to Nashville. After doing all that we end up being delayed almost 3 hours (so 6 hours total at this Airport). We could have rented a car and driven to Nashville in that timeframe which we would have preferred honestly because then maybe our toddler would have gotten some sleep. Once we finally made it to Nashville the baggage crew had us waiting almost an hour for our bags. Now coming back to Germany trip is where it gets worse. Nashville flight to Charlotte everything was fine with exception the plane we had this time had like micro storage above that no one could fit their carry on bags which caused a lot of bag drop off and pick up at flight gate and of course our travel stroller is the last item that comes out getting off that flight in Charlotte NC to transfer to our connection to Frankfurt Germany. At that gate (D9 specifically) in Charlotte NC is where I was having to deal with the very rude woman at the gate and that\\'s where I\\'m positive I also ended up leaving behind my brand new jacket while I was being rudely talked down to and ultimately had to just walk away to avoid further confrontation with this American Airlines employee. This all started with boarding the gate when the woman employee requested I fold down my stroller, so she could check its size in the metal carry on baggage thing they have near gate. Ok no problem I\\'m confident we will not have an issue as it\\'s the same plane we took coming here and I know the travel stroller fits in the overhead with no issues (Joolz Aer -specifically super lightweight and compact for airplane travel). My husband and child continue boarding as we have a carseat to install and need the time to do this, so I\\'m standing there with my stroller on the measuring thing and it fits perfectly when she started telling me no it\\'s too big and comes right on the max line for size and demanding I bag and tag it. I question her on this and said it was no issue coming here and fit fine to which I\\'m told, \"I don\\'t care what they let you do on that flight you\\'re not allowed to bring that stroller as a carry on because I say it wont fit and I just told some first class couple the same too about their stroller, so if they can\\'t bring it neither are you!\". OK wow, so I tell her my husband has the travel bag in the carry on suitcase and I need to leave and get on the plane to get it from him and I\\'ll be right back then to which I\\'m getting all this attitude from her and she began saying things like well that\\'s not my problem I didn\\'t tell him could go ahead and board. I quickly board and get the travel bag from my husband and run back out to the gate entrance to bag and tag the stroller. While doing this I sit down my jacket close by and then become rushed by an different attendant about tagging the bag. I ask her to give me a minute bag it and she sticks on the tag and hands me my receipt and tells me to bring it the gate drop off where I saw someone else leave their stroller near plane entrance. I pick it up and turn to grab by jacket when I\\'m suddenly screamed at.   I was originally booked to fly from El Paso, TX to Chicago on the Sat 1st Jan, this was cancelled. The \"alternative\" I was offered flew me to Chicago on Sun 2nd Jan but there were no ongoing flights available to my final destination of La Crosse WI until Tuesday 4th Jan therefore I would be stranded in Chicago for two days with two grandchildren in tow. American Airlines were no help at all in the regard, the \"alternative\" was unusable so was in reality no alternative at all. I took a different flight to Phoenix AZ and then connected to Madison WI because even though it was long and clearly going the wrong way it at least got me to Wisconsin on Sunday. I was then picked up from Madison and we drove home, if I wanted a long drive I would have flown from Chicago to start with, I fly from La Crosse because it\\'s my regional airport and I don\\'t want a long drive to get there. My luggage never arrived in Madison, clearly AA lost it somewhere along the way, it probably went in the first flight plane and was never moved over as AA staff promised me it would be. I\\'ve been able to find it arrived in Madison a full 24 hours after I did so clearly it was impossible for me to retrieve my luggage when I arrived. I have not been able to contact anyone from AA at all in regard to this, it is impossible to find out how you plan to re-unite me with my luggage that you lost. Worst customer service ever, in an industry not known for high levels of customer service, that takes some doing. My husband did warn me, he\\'s not an AA fan, I should have listened to him. I want my luggage back please.   Literally the worst experience ever, we were supposed to arrive at 10 am and now arriving at 7 pm and the time is still changing as I complete this review. Customer service provided absolutely no help. Absolutely terrible treatment of their paying customers and unacceptable.  It started off with a few gate changes at Miami Int\\'l as the inbound flight had been delayed and the airline decided to pull up a reserve aircraft. This did not stop the delay as we still had to wait for the crew to arrive from that delayed inbound, causing a domino delay for our flight. Onboard the 777-200, American provided zero service whatsoever. All that was given was a zip lock bag with a cookie and a bottle of water. They had no other food or drink options at all. Additionally, on the first leg, the seatback barely reclined (I could not imagine that recline was meant for a long haul flight!), and the entertainment system was broken for half of the aircraft. The only thing that was available through the \"your own device\" entertainment was a few news channels which could not be accessed as they required an adobe flash plug-in. Once we landed, construction at DFW and an aircraft blocking the taxiway caused even more delays which led to me missing my next leg. However, the gate agent rebooking me was very kind and even upgraded me to a \"preferred\" seat. The A321 that was operating the second leg was definitely showing its age. Service was the same as on the first leg. The tray table was slanted and unstable, and the seat felt wobbly and shaky. I usually bring a cup of noodles on board an aircraft as a meal for myself, and when I went up to one of the flight attendants she rudely declined to pour hot water in. I ended up going to a different FA, who was much nicer and cared about me. She poured in the water and provided utensils, as well as made sure that I was having a good experience. The second leg landed on time and we were off the aircraft in no time. Overall, the airline is not worth the money as I have paid much less with other carriers and received better service. The aircraft and seats were poor, however, some American staff made up for some of that. If you have a cheaper choice that includes a free carry-on and decent seat selection, I would recommend avoiding this airline.   This has to be the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly on. I flew out of Norfolk and they were delayed, missed my connecting flight to Seattle and had to wait 5 hrs for the next flight. We paid for preferred seating because I need a window seat and of course, didn\\'t get one. They changed the gates on me 5 different times, twice I had to get shuttles to the other side of the airport. And not to forget to mention that the planes are disgustingly dirty. I will never fly American Airlines again. I do not recommend them. Unlike Delta (better, way better airline) they don\\'t have veteran discounts for baggage.  25 years in the Air Force and they don\\'t have veteran privileges.   If you value your time, I recommend avoiding American Airlines. I was flying from Albuquerque, NM to Detroit, MI with a layover in Dallas, TX. Our plane required maintenance which delayed my flight by an hour. This caused me to miss my connecting flight to Detroit, so I was stranded in Dallas. After waiting over two hours in the customer service line, the airline provided me a hotel credit for the night and rescheduled my flights to Detroit. However, the hotel they provided was 40 minutes away from the airport, and I ran into additional delays the next day due to my plane being grounded. They ended up having to acquire another plane which delayed my flight an additional 2 hours. Overall, an entire day was wasted because of these delays, and the primary cause was poor plane maintenance which is concerning. Once again, if you value your time, I recommended avoiding this Airline.   I pay for flight nonstop SJO to JFK and return JFK to SJO nonstop! Change my return JFK to Miami (one stop ) to SJO with out notes. Call customer service I have to wait 6hrs to finally speak with the supervisor, but he answers nothing we can do. So what about the money paid for nonstop?  Because is cheaper but flight with extra stops. Thanks American Airlines so your great service!   I booked a flight from DFW to El Paso for Sun, Aug 1 at 4:40 pm. The Gate was changed 3 times and finally cancelled 10 min before boarding. I received a general announcement from AA that their computer system (Sabre) was down at 3pm. Then a few dark clouds rolled in and AA deleted the announcement and claimed weather was at fault for delays and cancellations. I was rebooked on Wed morning with later options offered with no offer to pay for hotel or expenses. I chose NOT to accept that offer of transportation TWO DAYS after I was scheduled to travel. I was eventually offered a flight at 9 pm on Aug 1 and accepted. I had already left the airport and was on a train to the Greyhound bus station at the time. I returned to DFW and at 8:30 when we were supposed to be boarding, the gate was changed. When I arrived at the second gate, AA delayed the flight until 10, then later until 10:40, then again changed the departure to 11 pm and changed gates again. All this time I was communicating with the people who were waiting in El Paso to pick me up who were waiting in El Paso, having driven in from a remote community a few hours away AA delayed the flight again at 11:30, then 12:04. At that point I finally told my ride that I would take an Uber so they could go back home after waiting for hours. AA delayed the flight ... again 1:20, then again to 1:40 and finally announced the cancellation at 2am in the morning. When the abandoned passengers surrounded the gate agent demanding hotel vouchers and rebooking, She said we would have to call the phone number that was not being answered, go to the app that stopped working or go to website that offered no service. The AA customer \"service\" center had a 1200 person line at 8 pm, but had already closed down with over a thousand people stranded. According to the gate agent there was a flight at 7 am but none of us would be rebooked on that flight as it was offered to the 39 people on standby that they sent away around 10 pm who had already been cancelled multiple times. The AA representative kept claiming that the \"weather\" was responsible when we could see it was clear and dry and other flights had been flying out since 8 pm. A different gate agent at 12 am had announced that they were still trying to find a crew for the plane at the same time the agent in charge kept blaming \"weather\" in a transparent attempt to divert responsibility. I had to pay $47 for an Uber and $170 for a hotel for a few hours sleep. In the morning of Aug 2 I attempted to call / reach AA from the \"What to do?\" card that the gate agent gave us at 2am ... instead of hotel / food / transportation vouchers. The response at that number was the same message I got all day on Aug 1, \"Don\\'t call us, we\\'ll call you after \"more than 4 hours!\" They did not call back. I finally gave up on reaching AA despite repeated and prolonged attempts to reach the company to rebook through: the AA app, the AA website, and the customer service numbers. I finally booked a flight through United for Aug 3 at 5:40 pm, which was the closest similar flight to my original that was offered by another airline.   Stranded my family in Dallas after mechanical troubles leaving JAX. Had to spend the night. Then had more mechanical troubles on new flight leaving next day for MIA to SDF. Was going to be stranded in MIA. Got off flight and was rebooked on non-stop to SDF only to have that airplane have mechanical troubles and grounded. Switched to new plane that was delayed leaving for DFW. Had no AA employee at the gate to field questions, so everyone in the dark. Then, they bumped my wife from the flight, assigned her to another one, but left my two kids on the original flight and refused to keep my family together. A true travel nightmare. AA exhibits a level of incompetence that I\\'ve never seen in 20 years of traveling for business.   While I was waiting for our plane to depart flying from Dallas to San Diego I remember hearing the flight attendant through the speakers thanking us for flying American and how the airline is doing everything they can to protect us during these times... I felt a chill run through me as I watched a plane full of terrified passengers. Such a surreal image, I felt mocked and ridiculed by American Airlines. Seating- We were a group of 3 traveling together but our seats were apart. When I approached the flight attendant at the gate (in Dallas on our way home to San Diego) to ask if they could move us and have us sit together (because you know, there is a pandemic going on and we wish to stay within \"our bubble\"), he didn\\'t even look at the screen to check he simply said: this is an full flight. WHAT? The announcement left me flabbergasted. A completely full flight during a pandemic? Didn\\'t American reassure me they were doing everything they could? What happened to the promised social distancing measures on the aircraft to ensure OUR safety? What happened to leaving empty seats to try to maintain distance? How come small businesses have to comply with this measure costing them greatly but one of the biggest corporations in the world can\\'t be held accountable? So WHY is the company not implementing social distance guidelines? Furthermore, this employee didn\\'t even try moving passengers around so we could sit together; not just for our safety but for the safety of others. Did not bother, did not care. 2. Boarding- all other major airlines I have flown with since this whole thing started have been boarding backwards starting from the end of the plane. This is to avoid people standing in the aisle while people are seated. But not American Airlines, no. As we sat, there were hundreds of passengers looming over us waiting for the line to move.  Another thing I didn\\'t see was the temperature check. I saw at least 1 very sick passenger, pale with visible sweats and barely able to stand or walk straight. I am not saying it was due to COVID but I had to certify that I didn\\'t have any symptoms when flying so why was this person traveling with an illness? I would have expected any sick person to stay at home and for the company to implement that so passengers feel SAFE. Another thing that concerned me was that a lot of passengers were wearing their masks under their nose and the crew members allowed them to. So when I received an email with a survey asking if I would recommend others to fly American Airlines the answer is simple: NO. Or at least not yet. Even though American Airlines have implemented many other excellent measures (requiring face masks during the duration of the flight as well as adding HEPA filters and electrostatic sprays inside the aircraft to kill germs and viruses), this is simply not enough to travel with the absolute confidence you promised us. Small locally owned businesses with less resources have stricter rules and more drastic measures than what I experienced during my flight. I will hold American Airlines (and any other major corporation) to the highest standards simply because we should.    Too many delays it’s insane. I have picked 2 different flights and both are delayed. If your going to be delayed at least share the true reason once known to passengers awaiting the plane.   They are the worst airline out there. It’s countless delays. They had us board a 8:35 pm plane then told us after we boarded that the plane was just towed over here for a maintenance issue. Turns out a hydraulic needed replacement and it would take an hour. This was at 9pm. So we’ve been delayed a hour and a half sitting in a plane like a sardine in a can with no airflow and stinky people. They don’t care. & have no accommodation for there passengers. They will never receive my money again.!   I am writing a review because my daughter\\'s and 4 of my grand children all ages 3 yrs old to newborn got dropped off at the airport for their return flight home to Detroit today. Upon checking in they were told their flight is delayed due to weather related issues. This airline needs to accommodate passengers if they are delayed due to weather. My kids and grand kids should not be stranded in a airport overnight. The airport didn\\'t try to accommodate them and put them on another airline or anything. The same way they are willing to accept payment they should be willing to accommodate passengers. Who wants to be stranded or sleep in an airport with 4 children? Then I just spent 3 hours on hold trying to speak with someone.   Less than 6 hours to my flight and I received a text stating that my flight had been canceled. Sent another text stating I had been rebooked for 2 days later. Unprofessional and very inconsiderate, last minute and still unsure how they are going to compensate charges that have already occurred. I already didn’t like AA but by a family member requesting not going through another airline that is still showing current I swear I will do anything and everything to make sure AA keeps their bad name.  This was the second chance I gave American Airlines after having a terrible experience with them over 5 years ago. This time around my wife insisted on booking through American Airlines again because of points and discounted rates. The first time they lost 3 of our checked bags and returned them after more than 6 months with missing items. After filling out a missing items form they only credited less than 40% of the items actual worth. Second time around they forced us to check bags before boarding the plane even though they were within the required size and weight. I argued that they were within the limit and told them of my previous experience. The control freak flight attendant then tried to threaten me stating I wouldn’t be boarding the plane and asked me to get in the back of the line. My wife then starts crying as we’re heading to our Honeymoon. Her reason was because they “are tired of having passengers argue with them”. After my wife convinced me to apologize so that we could board and having to listen to a mini lecture from the flight attendant to finish it all off she then turns to my wife and says “I hope you have a happy life together but these are signs my friend” referring to me because I decided to stand up to her and argue a completely valid point. I have flown with JetBlue, Virgin, Azul, United to name a few and never had any issues the way I’ve had with American Airlines. I will never fly with American Airlines ever again. Pay the extra $100 and go with a different airline company. You will have a much better experience and not have to risk ruining your trip.   Disaster from the start. First round, flight canceled set us back a whole day in our trip. On the way home absolutely chaotic. Will never recommend AA to anyone ever! Also at this point a hotel and food vouchers, if we are even offered them is a slap in the face. Standing in a line that was more than 100 people long, with equally angry people. Told at one point we may make it home tomorrow. Will find out if we ever make it to the service counter. Didn\\'t call since the lady in front of us has been trying for 3 hours to talk to a live human.  We have had the most disappointing experience. This caused us to lose an entire day and we paid for excursions that couldn’t be refunded. My Mom, sister, and I were going on the trip of lifetime to Barcelona. We boarded the plane in Philadelphia and sat on it for two hours before we had to get off after two hours. We were told there was multiple failures. How were we even able to board? We got off the plane with no instructions. We were supposed to get our meal/dinner on the plane and they gave us a $12 meal voucher so we could get a bag of Cheetos in the airport - LOL! At that time most of the restaurants were not serving food any longer. They provided us with a hotel and shuttle service. The hotel left much to be desired and we ended up getting an Uber because the line was so long to get a shuttle. We also found out that a flight to Paris was also cancelled. The next day we came back we sat in an area and left our travel pillows and a set of crutches in a back seating area. We grabbed lunch and came back to the area with a flight attendant sitting there. She said those were her pillows and we couldn’t sit there. We asked why and she said it was for crew. I asked why we couldn’t sit there because there was no signage for indicating we couldn’t sit there. She asked if I knew I was talking to and I said are you an employee. She said yes and I asked her name. She threatened to call security. Mind you I am in a wheelchair. I told her go for it! I can’t go anywhere fast. She eventually left the area and everyone around us thought she was totally inappropriate. I will definitely consider this experience as we consider flying in the future.   American Airlines continues to be the biggest embarrassment in the air. Their overhead compartments are full half way through boarding, for my second consecutive flight. I travel with sensitive work equipment that fits into a bag specifically designed to fit overhead so it is not mistreated by baggage handlers. Here I sit, again, left with no choice to have my equipment mistreated because they cannot police their own baggage policies. Infuriating. Alaskan Airlines is a subsidiary and puts this to shame.   Our flight was canceled and then rescheduled for the next day, which meant we had to book a last-minute hotel and stay on our trip an extra day, incurring extra expenses of a few hundred dollars. AA offered no apology, and when I asked to have even just a complimentary seat change, they wouldn’t even do that. They lost us as customers.  Horrible airline! Rude staff! Last minute cancellations. Wouldn’t even give us a hotel to stay in for my boyfriends birthday when they cancelled our flight, stranded us in a layover airport and expected us to wait 48 hours for a new flight to our destination airport in an unknown city due to their errors. Wouldn’t rebook us on a flight with another airline. Also, lost our bags! So we had to cancel our entire trip.   I have never been through such a hectic, disorganized travel experience! The delays and cancellations at the last minute. Miscommunication and maintenance issues. The worst experience ever. I finally had to get a flight an hour away from home or my “new” flight, would’ve been the next afternoon. Then that flight was delayed too!!!!! I wouldn’t believe this mess myself if I wasn’t living it.  Milwaukee to Lihue via Phoenix. American Airlines is terrible for customer satisfaction. It is the only airline where booking together doesn’t mean you will have seats next to one another. My husband and I booked two tickets to Hawaii from the Midwest. This was over 10 hours of air travel. Not only were our original seats not together (completely unheard of on other airlines) but there were not even two seats together available for the additional charges if picking a seat. I understand charging to make a specific seat selection but getting two seats together should be a basic courtesy when booking two flights together. I will never fly this airline again. Convinced me that I am a Delta customer for life - even when the costs are more. \\xa0\\xa0Flight was cancelled while we were en route to airport. AA stranded us in a foreign country (it was spring break and our hotel was sold out so we had nowhere to stay). We initially had a nonstop AM flight, late that night, AA managed to get us into the US but cancelled our connecting flight and couldn\\'t tell us when they\\'d be able to fly us out. The line for customer service stretched all the way down the terminal (AA claimed storms in the midwest were the issue, however no other airline was cancelling flights. I presume some of them also fly through the midwest). After an hour in line, while simultaneously holding for an agent on the phone, we were told they couldn\\'t get us home until two days later. I wound up buying tickets on United just to get my kids back in time for school. I\\'ve flown at least six legs on American so far this year and not a single one left on time nor landed on time.   American was late not due to weather. We missed the connecting flight by 14 mins. We were at the connecting gate at 14min. The cut off is 15min. They would not hold the plane. Then the agents at the desk would not rebook for another flight due to too many missing their flight. The name American should be taken from the airline. There is no courtesy, no compassion, and zero customer service. We had to call reservations to to book flights. They would not gives us our bags nor book a flight. This is holding people hostage. That is illegal including the state of Texas. I will never fly this excuse for a company ever again.   We had a connecting flight where they closed the gate on us right as we rushed there. They didn\\'t even realize we were on a connection when they looked at our boarding passes and said \"well you have to get here with enough time so that you don\\'t miss your flight\". Completely smug attitude with no sense or urgency. We explained that we had a connection and the flight still had 15-20 mins until it\\'s scheduled departure time and how did they not see that the two missing passengers were from a connecting American Airlines flight that had just landed. It\\'s like they\\'ve never dealt with a connecting flight before. I get if the flight is 30+ minutes late and you can\\'t hold up another departing flight for that long but there was still PLENTY of time to spare. Horrible gate agent not doing the basics simply seeing where the two missing passengers were coming from. The manager came and said it would take too long to reopen the flights. I get when the gate is closed and all that final stuff but they closed it 20 minutes before the flight and should have known we were coming from a connection. A good airline would take notice of that and hold off for as long as possible. I\\'ve had this happen before with Southwest and they did the right thing. We argued with this guy for 20 minutes telling us how long it would take to reopen the flight blah blah while watching our plane still just sit there and not even back up yet. We would have been in our seats sitting down 10-15 minutes ago but all he would do is say \"sorry nothing we can do\" Ridiculous. Airline is run by lazy clowns, it\\'s no wonder they had all that controversy during covid kicking families off planes for their 1 year old not having a mask on. Absolute clown of an airline.  This airline scammed their own frequent flyer member. I checked in online the night before the flight, as I always do and discovered that it would not allow me to receive my ticket on my phone as I usually do. It told me to print out my ticket at the kiosk at the airport...OK, fine, Ill do that, maybe its a pandemic thing. I get to the kiosk and it doesnt seem to be working after a few minutes of inputting my information and it prints out a weird paper that tells me to take it to the \"help\" desk (not very helpful). The lady at the desk tells me that the slip the kiosk printed out was 1 minute passed the time they are allowed to check customers into a flight thats leaving within the hour. (Never heard of this before) None of this should have ever happened since their server didnt allow me to get my ticket online. Then they made me buy another flight the next day for an extra $250. What an absolute joke of a business.   \\r\\nI was on flight 1505 from DFW to Indianapolis on 15 Nov and I had a fainting spell. I\\'m so grateful to the Flight Attendants, the Nurses that were on the Plane and the Passengers that assisted. I didn\\'t get the names of everyone, but Shantel (I hope this is right) was the Nurse that stayed with me along with Christine (a Passenger) until my daughter got there to place me in the car. The Flight Attendants were so wonderful, they didn\\'t make me feel like was a bother to them. They kept reassuring and checking on me until we landed. I know that it\\'s part of their job to look after the Passengers but not everyone take this part of Customer Service this seriously. I can\\'t put into words just how grateful I am, it was very scary and I was Traveling along. God Bless each and everyone that took care of me as well as the other Passengers, I was told by some others that they were Praying for me as I left.   Miami to New York JFK. I am so pleased with American Airline rebooking station in Miami FL. After our flight was cancelled from Miami to Hartford (1/16/22) due to weather, we were so upset considering we were traveling with my 82 year old (handicapped) mother. They spent a lot of time trying to resolve our flight situation so we could get back home ASAP. Above all else they were super accommodating and understanding towards my mothers situation. They went above and beyond to find us the soonest flight to the closest airport near Hartford, while also providing us with travel, meal and stay vouchers to accommodate my mothers situation. I tried my best to tip them for the help and great attitude but they would not accept explaining that it was part of the  job and they were happy to help. I understand how short staffed the world is nowadays. Thank you for getting us home safe.   On November 2nd, 2021 I was taking a flight home i from Houston to Miami. The plane was delayed 2 hours because of a fuel issue in Miami. When we boarded immediately the crew started jumping into action to help us all get seated in a timely manner so we could make up for some of the delay. There were many passengers on board that were looking at missing their connection flight. One of the Stewards stood out during the whole flight. His name was Thomas ... as everyone boarded he took their carry on luggage and stored it,  told them to take their seats and as each bin was filled he closed the bin and went on to the next. He made what would normally be a half an hour procedure get done in under 10 minutes. Everyone secured in their seats he then proceeded with Kelly the Stewardess to serve snacks,  they even came around and gave us extra cookies if wanted. After the snack service was over he proceeded to go over each person who had connection issues tickets and told them where to go and what to do so they would not miss their connecting flights. I am 75 and I can tell you that every time I got out of my seat he was right there to steady me. The Pilot too was over and above as these were the best take offs and landings I have ever experienced in all my years flying and it was pouting rain when we arrived, One of the Stewardesses up front (unfortunately I did not get her name) physically went with a group of three passengers to pick up their luggage and to the ticket counter so they could make their connecting flight. They had not checked their bags all the way through which made the time frame almost impossible,  We have never flown with American. Due to the pandemic it was the most available option for us and we had to push our vacation. Upon booking my child was under age. We flew out 72 hours after my child turned 2 years old. American Airlines refused to price match us, we had to pay over $400 for a ticket for a child who was 72 hours of being 2 years old. We couldn\\'t even utilize her seats because she was rows ahead of us. This occurred on all 4 flights. The employees on the first flight from Dayton were great. The next 3 flights were awful and disheartening. Staff on and off the flight were rude and not helpful when trying to arrange seats together. Overseeing 4 kids, a baby and trying to get checked in for a flight can be a struggle to run smoothly. Myself and 3 children are exempt from wearing masks. I stated that and moved on. On the 3rd flight an employee actually followed me down the boarding aisle while talking loudly to have everyone in my group put masks on. She caught up to us as I was folding the stroller to put off to the side to make a scene in front of other my children and other passengers about the Non mask-wearing. For the children who are able to wear a masks I gave no rebuttal about it. She\\'s an airline employee, not a Doctor. Her opinions will not trump medical advice. Meanwhile, Americans own flight staff didn\\'t even comply with a mask (which I don\\'t mind). However, I was harassed by ground service staff. Picture provided. I own a business and have never nor would never treat my clients this way.  Horrible customer service at the Albany airport. Our mobile tickets were invalid at the security check and they sent us to the ticket counter. The agent said she was the only one there and would not reprint boarding passes as she was only checking in bags. We arrived 2.5 hours before flight departure and after waiting an hour for security check then another 30 min at the ticket counter, the agent refused to print boarding passes and refused to rebook us. Took us another hour on the phone to find out there were no available flights today so we got a rental car and are now driving 12 hours back to Ky. Will never fly to or from this airport again. Will never book American Airlines again.  I recently purchased 3 tickets and seats to go to a wedding. I specifically purchased all seats in the same row. My mother is handicap and my daughter will only fly if seated next to me. The flight was rescheduled, and my seats were reassigned. I called and explained the situation to the AA representative. She was nice but would not accommodate my seating. I told her I paid over $120 for specific seats. She let me know I could repurchase the seats, but she could not make the change. It\\'s absolutely insane. Needless to say, my daughter won\\'t fly, so I had to cancel her flight. NO REFUND. Now she is upset and can\\'t go to her cousins wedding. To everyone out there, think twice before choosing American Airlines if you want to sit with your loved ones.   I will never give American Airlines my business again. Not only did our flight board late, with no acknowledgement that this was taking place, but it left 1.5 hours late from Jamaica. Therefore, us (with many many other passengers) missed our connecting flights (which were the last flights of the day) causing us to be stranded until the next day. The worst part was the horrible customer service. The customer service reps had a chip on their shoulders the minute they were approached at the desk. They argued with the customer’s for hours about the fact that the missed flights were due to the airline’s delays. After several hours, they finally acknowledged the airline’s fault of the missed flights. By that time, most passengers gave up on trying to get a hotel room and transportation due to the terrible attitudes of the representatives. To top this horrible experience off, they mocked the fact that we had no luggage for the night and would go without very important medications for 12+ hours. Stuff happens but the horrible customer service is very unnecessary and I will not give 1 more penny of my hard earned money to such a terrible company.   Los Angeles to Dallas Fort-Worth onboard AA2833 on their A321-200. My flight departed from the rather small-sized Terminal 4, and with the amount of layover I had plus the quick service in Los Angeles, I had plenty of time to kill in the Admirals Club lounge which was very cozy and comfortable. The staff in Los Angeles were just okay. Boarding started on schedule and it was very disciplined, and I was welcomed in quite a friendly way by the crews. Take-off was only 10 minutes late, but eventually, we landed half an hour ahead of schedule. Their A321 had slightly larger overhead bins and strip LED lighting, but sadly no personal TVs. The seat was cozy and comfortable, easy to use, and adequately spacious for a 2.5-hour flight like this. Throughout the flight, the flight attendants were friendly, courteous, and attentive, although they could\\'ve been better if they were not just meddling with their phones and re-ensure that everyone is doing okay. once the service is complete. The Biscoff biscuit was exquisite and tasty. The real positive thing about this flight was the Wi-Fi. It allowed me to browse anything, open social media apps, and watch videos on the ground for around 20 minutes. Once I took off, the social media apps and browsing feature no longer existed, but live TV shows, videos, movies, and games were provided through the American Airlines portal. The signal strength was quite poor, but the contents and the layout of the portal were incredibly good. Despite landing 30 minutes ahead of schedule, the baggage delivery at Dallas Fort Worth was ridiculously slow, causing me to wait around 45-60 minutes. Overall, my experience and first impression onboard American Airlines was somewhat impressive. Also, if you\\'re asking for help, contact them via Twitter or use the Live Chat feature. They can sometimes be faster than the phone team.    Yesterday, I traveled from Doha to Philadelphia on May 14th, 2024. While I appreciated the hard work of the American Airline cabin crew, I encountered an issue regarding access to drinking water. When I raised the concern, I was met with dismissiveness, prompting me to report the incident to the supervisor. Later, I overheard the crew mocking my complaint, highlighting a need for improved customer service training. Airlines should prioritize respectful and attentive care for passengers.   There is no customer service. Good luck getting anyone to help you out in any satisfying way because they simply do not care. I had arrived at the AA terminal with 40 minutes to spare so I stopped by the restroom and headed to the gate 30 minutes before my scheduled flight. To my surprise we had to take a shuttle from the terminal we were at to take the one I was assigned to. I get a little bit anxious and asked the shuttle attendant when the next one is coming. I tell her my flight and ask if I\\'ll make it on time. She confidently tells me not to worry and that we\\'ll make it on time. Obviously, we did not make it in time. The shuttle took another 15 minutes before it left. By the time we got to our terminal, it was 10 minutes before our scheduled departure and they had shut the gates. The shuttle should have called the terminal for our flight and let them know that there was a group of 10 getting delayed because the shuttle was taking a long time. His condescending attitude towards us made it clear he was only there to get us off his back and not to provide any meaningful customer solution to our huge inconvenience. There should be tight communication with the shuttle to prevent this from happening and it would also be nice to give a notice on the app or via email or phone call about shuttle connections. I don\\'t fly often! Unfortunately, I didn\\'t know this was something I had to prepare for. That\\'s American Airlines, I guess.  RNO-DFW. Pleasantly surprised after seeing all the reviews. Easy check-in and luggage checked through to final destination of London with British Airways. Luggage arrived safely in London with no issue. Ground staff and cabin crew were fine. On time departure and arrival in Dallas. Easy transfer over to British Airways after AA flight. Pre-selected no fee seats were honored. Beverages were served. It was nice to receive a full can of soda and not just a cup full. The 2.5 hour flight passed quickly. No fuss, no drama. Well done. I\\'ll just take off one point here because of the hard landing in Dallas.   The entire plane had to deplane due to a malfunction - originally told it would be a 2 hr delay but turned out to be 8hrs. No apologies, told not to bother the gate staff for assistance and that we would be given a QR code to rebook our flights - none were given and we were told to gather our bags and go back to the ticket counter. Missed my connecting flight and had to rebook via customer service who would not honor nor credit my first class upgrade because it was an add on. When the initial flight did resume, it was practically empty and the flight attendants were dismissive and rude. I was panicked that I would only have 30 min to catch my connecting flight, which was located at another terminal and was seeking information on whether I should deplane and book another flight for the next day - I was told by the flight attendant to return to my seat because they have more important things to handle right now. When I asked for her name she told me that she does not have to tell anyone for their name and continued to walk briskly down the aisle and ignore my issues. She went on to hide behind a partition. The audacity of this person to be so dismissive and rude is beyond comprehension but the only thing to make it all worse was American Airlines customer relations offering 2,500 bonus miles as retribution. Basically my experience and trauma is worth very little to them   This is the last time I fly with American. After we were at the airport, I got a message that my flight was canceled and that they were trying to rebook me. Well that didn\\'t happen. While all of the passengers were waiting for the luggage, they handed us some cards so we can change the flight ourselves. I was flying to Texas to spend New Year\\'s eve with my family and the only flight I could get is one that arrives after 10pm of the New Year\\'s eve, and if they cancel this one too I\\'m completely screwed. So I check in the surrounding airports but I can\\'t even change the airport I\\'m leaving. I call customer service and the lady was like, well that\\'s all I got, but I can offer you a refund. I don\\'t want a refund! I want to make it to my family! She didn\\'t even try to help me. I told her that definitely I\\'m not going to fly more with this company and she was just in a whatever attitude. I use that airline just because it is the only one that leaves from the Newport News airport, but I will just go to Norfolk or Richmond next time so I can use Delta instead.   I have flown many airlines and refuse to fly American again. The attendants are rude, they are slow and not responsive to issues. They refused my son and I boarding in Dallas and we missed our connection in Japan and they cancelled our return flights and rebooked a much longer flight and refused to reimburse.   It was terrible. My flight was canceled. No announcement about flight cancellations. Customer service was very rude. I called American Airlines customer service. Flight was rescheduled. I was promised that my suitcase will follow me. Never happened Now, in the middle of the night, after terrible flight with a lot of waiting time, I am sitting in the airport and waiting for my suitcase to come with another flight because they will deliver my stuff in 24-48 hours   I\\'m pleased with the flights and the staff. I understand that delays might happen on occasion, and difficulties. One such example is a mechanical issue on engine start, which happened on my return, at Tampa. The message from the pilot was clear. The problem was fixed luckily after a short period of time. The captain kept us informed. This is flight AA 1466 on 11/8/22. There is nothing that could have been done better by staff, for the 4 flights on this round trip. Thank you, captain and staff.   I asked the flight attendant why the Exit row was empty. And if we can move some passengers there, in case of an emergency, she denied and said those were more expensive seats. (What means than profit in more important than security for this company.   Never again! Berlin - Mexico City: Flight to Mexico got cancelled in advance without any notice. We got informed at the check-in / baggage counter at the airport that the flight does not exist. We had to organize an alternative flight ourselves. Cancún - Berlin (return flight) Super unfriendly passenger assistant at the check-in counter. Assigned separate seats across the plane to me and my partner on both long-distance flights. Didn\\'t make any attempt / care to change seats after informing about flight anxiety. Never flying with American Airlines again!   American Airlines needs to stop using Covid as an excuse for their excessive lack of service. I flew SFO-JFK round trip Oct. 3rd through 7th in 1st class on their flagship flights (supposedly of a better quality than regular first). After paying almost $5000 I was extremely dissatisfied upon my return. We left SFO without complication, but no Flagship lounge was open at SFO and there were no \"fast tracks\" through security. The seats and cabin were fine on both flights, but the service was much better from SFO. The food was what used to be a regular coach meal. It was all on one tray and not really edible, and no pre-departure beverage offered. The flight attendant was extremely nice and attentive though. The flight back from JFK was an extremely different experience. After the hideous line and rude treatment through TSA we were happy to be in the recently opened Flagship lounge and enjoyed a fabulous meal (maybe the best of our trip) at the restaurant there. The flight left on time and again no pre flight beverage offered and there wasn\\'t even a menu which is usually there even though you can place your order online before the flight if preferred. The flight attendant\\'s were hit and miss sitting for the majority of the flight. When the meal tray was placed in front on me it was just laughable. It was described online as \"the chef\\'s special pasta\" but was a disgusting, dried up serving of canned Chef Boyardee ravioli. It was served with a roll in a plastic wrapper, some sort of weird side dish and what they called cheesecake but was really rubbery. None of it was edible. The flight attendant offered to get me whatever was left over (some type of beef), but I declined. No glassware on this flight and plastic cups were given with only about 1/4 filled and only refreshed if asked. There is no excuse for charging full premium fares and saying that Covid prevents them from offering their normal 1st class service. Most other airlines, especially overseas, have gone back to full service. AA is holding on to the Covid excuse to cut corners and gouge customers. I usually try to avoid this airline, but always forget how truly bad the service is until I dare to try it again.   These people do not know how to check a plane before boarding all the people. We all boarded the plane and after an hour of waiting, the captain says \"I’m here with bad news the airplane isn’t working so we have to get off\". Wasted $200 on this ticket for this.   Had a trip planned for the 4th of July holiday. We were scheduled to fly American airlines out of Austin Bergstrom with a connection to Bozeman Montana out of Dallas. Our flight was scheduled to board at 5:55 AM on July 1st . We checked the TSA wait times via the TSA app and arrived at the airport 1 hour and 45 minutes hours early to ensure enough time to check bags and get thru the TSA security process. The line to check bags at American was out the door. No other airline had similarly long lines that morning. There were only four American employees working the check in counters. We were in line for almost 2 hours and ended up missing our flight. Once we got to the check in desk, we were told that the best they could do was put us on a 5:30PM flight to catch a connection in Dallas to our final destination. The only problem was that we would be on standby for the connecting flight and that the connecting flight was fully booked. Thanks so much American. Stranding us in Dallas did not seem to be a reasonable solution. I have two problems with American airlines after this less than pleasant experience. At no time did an American employee appear to ask people in the check in line when their boarding times were. I travel frequently and when traveling with other airlines I have never missed a flight due to check in delays. Invariably all other airline companies I have ever dealt with always seem to have employee(s) working long check in lines making sure no one misses a flight. Apparently, this does not occur to anyone working at American.  After missing our flight we requested ticket refund. They denied the refund request and insisted on a credit Based on the inconvenience of missing the flight and the incompetence of how American handled the problem I think a refund would be reasonable. Americans recent proclivity to cancel flights seemingly on a whim combined with a total disregard for customers in my mind makes a future travel credit all but worthless. Epic fail American airlines. After reading some of these reviews it\\'s clear that customer feedback is meaningless to you. \\xa0\\xa0Flight was delayed then night before without reason. We get there and it was delayed two more times and then cancelled. Due to weather. Make that make sense. It barely rained also. We go to figure out what’s going on and no reimbursement because “weather” how convenient. They automatically booked us on the flight the next day and told us our luggage would be sent with it. Excuse me but I need my stuff for the night. So we waited 3 hours to have our luggage sent out. Every single employee gave us a different story. We watched them belittle anyone who asked about their luggage, call the police on a man because he refused to take his bag. His bag was open and his stuff was all over the floor next to it and the employee kicked his bag to him: then she told him to lower his voice. None of us could hear him, he kept his cool. She was yelling. I will never fly them again. They said I can’t have a refund because my ticket had a no refund policy, they’re the ones who cancelled the flight. I finally got a refund and booked United. The flight they had put me on tomorrow is already delayed. Thank god for United airlines   Worst airline ever! Because the Miami security check took 1 1/2 hours to get through we missed our flight. We then had to wait in line another 1 1/2 hours in the Rebooking line located in the terminal next to our gate. My first clue was that a Rebooking desk existed at all. I’ve never seen this with any other airline I’ve used. 50 people were already in line ahead of us and soon another 50 were behind us.  What should have been a direct 3 1/2 hour flight turned out to be an all day marathon at 3 different airports. I suggest you avoid this airline at all costs.   American Airlines in April, \"We\\'re all in this together, be patient and understanding with us.\" American Airlines on Christmas Day, \"You booked a flight 23 hours before scheduled departure, in order to be eligible for a refund it had to be 24 hours.\" Has anyone there taken a single management class? You get to keep my $1,400 and require me to use it as a voucher and your actions guarantee that you will never get another dollar of my money as long as I live. Not the best long-term strategy.   The flight had smoke in cabin and immediately landed. Emergency Crews boarded and tended to plane. All customers were at closed Atlanta airport with no open restaurant for hours. 2 hour line to rebook hotel/flight with only 2 people working to rebook. Eventually we flew out later that night and got home at 3am. They gave some of my coworkers $175 vouchers, but after sending email to customer relation, they gave me zero credit. Everyone had same experience on plane - however they don\\'t treat customers equal. On top of that you can only reach Customer relations by email - you CANNOT talk to them on the phone. Bottom line -  if something happens with your flight, you roll the dice on email to get it resolved after the fact. Will not ever trust this Airline again. Shame on their customer service.   Fly another airline! They just canceled our flight for the 5th time, with no compensation. We’ve had to pay out of pocket for a hotel for 3 days. Our luggage has been checked and we have no rental car. Our infant is without food and diapers and they do not care at all. The worst traveling experience I’ve ever had.   I am Platinum with American, so I have lots of miles logged over the past 10 years. I was just forced to fly Delta on a trip and can\\'t believe how much better an experience it was. Night and day. I had become numb to the rudeness, poor service and general apathy of American. Not anymore! Gate agents, especially at Philly and Charlotte are rude, condescending and simply uncaring in most cases. Please watch the Philly ground crowd throw your bags around. No plugs, even on newer planes. Food is a joke compared to Delta. I\\'m done with American. If you can get on Delta, try it and trust a long time traveler. American is horrible.  What a joke! This has got to be hands down the worlds worst airline. I have flown American many times. This will be my last time. Talk about a 2nd rate airline. I wouldn’t even say they are a 10th rate airline. You get what you pay for folks. If saving 20 bucks is your main priority then this airline is for you. Here is what you get for that 20 bucks you just saved - cancelled flights, non caring customer service, and management that yells at you for them cancelling your flight. They put the American Airlines terminals in the worst areas of the airports. I never noticed until today walking to other airline terminals where they have much better shops and better food options. They also have poor seats that have little to no power access to charge your phones. They lied about why they cancel your flight so they will not have to pay for your hotel. My original flight had a connecting flight in DFW and it magically got cancelled for weather. The airline had multiple flights going to other cities that was not cancelled. I finally found out it was overbooked from the agent. What a business practice for a greedy airline that would rather overbook and leave someone stranded then to just cut off reservations once the plane is full. So if saving 20 dollars is your goal good luck putting up with everything that goes with it!  Never again with this airline. Second time we have been rerouted and left stranded at an airport with no resolution to getting to final destination! This time it was again due to weather that we were sent to Austin, had to land due to shortage of fuel and an oil light came on engine. After 3 hours engine wouldn\\'t start so we were removed from plane without further arrangements or plans to continue on to our final destination.   One of the worst first class experiences ever. In-flight entertainment nonexistent. How difficult is it to properly provide wifi or streaming. Delta was way better on the trip down. I will never use American airlines again. Clown shoes. Super disappointing.  As I was landing in Phoenix to catch the final Let of my return home, I received a text that my flight from Phoenix to Orange County (Santa Ana) was cancelled. There were no other options to fly into Southern California. American did the right thing by providing a hotel. But their system failed to provide a transportation voucher to the hotel (no airport transportation offered by the hotel according to the AA information). The real insult was that I landed at 7.30pm local time. I can’t fly out till tomorrow morning. I was speaking with an AA agent. AA gave me a $12 (twelve dollar) voucher for Dinner or Breakfast! Are you serious? What airport or hotel offers a nutritious, filling meal for $12 (including tax and tip)? I had the agent contact the customer sat depart three times during our conversation. AA refused to give more than $12. I am a Platinum For Life AA customer (over 2 million lifetime miles) and this is how they thank me for all the business I have given them? If Airlines show no loyalty, how can they expect any from customers? I am beyond disappointed.   By far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. My original flight was to depart at 7.45 am. We boarded the plane, and they realized there was a problem. We were told that it would take about 20 minutes to fix. An hour later we were de-planing. We were then told that we would be leaving by 10.00 am. 10.00 am came and went. We went 5 hours without a single update, and I missed not one, not two, but three connecting flights. We didn’t end up departing until 3.45 pm. They really had an entire flight sit at the airport for 8 hours, meanwhile they had another flight to CLT at 2.00 pm, and they did not switch or make any attempts to have passengers that had been waiting for 8+ hours to get on that flight. There was little to no communication and we were all left in the dark for hours and hours. It is now taking me 16 hours to get home, which, typically, is a 3 hour flight. On top of it, they did not serve any water or beverages on the flight. I understand this is “normal” protocol for a short flight, however it is not normal to sit at an airport for an 8 hour delay. None of us were reimbursed or given food vouchers despite being at an airport for all 3 meals. I will never, and I mean never fly AA ever again. By far the most awful travel experience, ever.   This is the worst experience. I paid good money to have aisle seats and because our flight was canceled for no known reason, we were bumped to middle seats. I did not pick middle seats for a reason. I paid to have aisle seats and should gave had seats changed to the exact same choice. I doubt I will fly American again. This is the third time we have been screwed by American.   This company delayed the flight for three hours without any explanations. Then three hours late, this company issued extra tickets for those who landed late from their previous flight. Due to that the entire passengers in this airplane had to seat and waited extra 30 mins. Still none of these customers did not get any proper explanations nor apologies from this company.  My 21 year old daughter broke her foot while on a mission trip in Arlington, TX. We booked a flight to rush her home in an attempt to minimize the potential damage to the foot and get in to our doctor. She arrived at the airport in plenty of time, checked in and made it to the gate. The airline took her crutches and told her to wait. Then the airline changed the departure gate. By the time she made her way to the new gate (without airline assistance) they would not let her board the plane. The on-boarding time had passed. The plane was still at the gate. So, now she’s waiting for the next flight, hours later, with no crutches and no assistance.  The USA government and Dr Fauci recommend people stay 6 ft apart. On my recent flight on American Airlines, I was seated 1ft apart from a stranger. My spouse accompanied me but he too was seated 1 ft from a stranger. Meanwhile, even though I am vaccinated, my comfortable gaiter face covering was unacceptable. I would not recommend flying American Airlines. They claim to be concerned about safety but all they care about is money.   I want to shed light on American Airlines and their horrible experience they have given me and my child. From a cancelled flight coming out of New Orleans, American has not been accommodating to its customers. Once our flight was cancelled we waited in line for over 2 hours to get rerouted home to Nashville. This was on Monday, 7/8, the gate agent said I can’t get you on a flight home until Wednesday morning. Being in a city we are not familiar with we were left to oblige by the new flight. When asked do we get any accommodations they said oh yeah I will accommodate one night in a hotel and a $12 voucher per person. We were being delayed for 2 days so when I asked for additional night, they said I had to wake up early bring all my luggage back to the airport to get another night accommodation. First off that is ridiculous 2nd why do I have to inconveniently bring all my stuff back to the airport to get another hotel voucher and go back to the hotel with our stuff? Not to mention what meal in an airport is $12. They gave us $12 for one day. I found a flight myself that would get us home on 7/9 that went from New Orleans to Miami then Miami to Nashville. I called customer service myself and got my flight changed after being told they couldn’t get me out til Wednesday. Today, 7/9 we get up check out the hotel and head tot the airport where we had to be there for 6 1/2 hours before our flight left due to check out time. I went to the counter to ask for another meal voucher and they said you already got one. I had to ask for a supervisor and complain for us to get another $12 voucher for the day. It’s about an hour out from us about to take off for Miami and we see our flight is delayed by 15 minutes not to bad but I started to look closely. There was not plane at our gate. Here it is 645, when we were supposed to leave at 6:30 and no plane. The plane arrives at 7 and they rushed the boarding process to try and take off and now we are on a delay while on the plane because of weather. We sat on the hot plane a whole 1 hour before they sent the people out to load our luggage, which took an additional 30 minutes. It is now 804 and I am now going to clearly miss our connection home, which left Miami at 1030pm. We finally depart and arrive to Miami at 11:10pm. I go to customer service to get another flight home to Nashville. She books us then I ask for hotel accommodation and meal vouchers and they stated you already had one and we can not issue you another one. I said so me and my daughter because of your original cancelled flight have to suffer and sleep at the airport. They shrugged their shoulders and said sorry. I then went to go find my luggage and see about finding a hotel at midnight and they can’t find my luggage. The lady from American said it will meet you in Nashville in the morning. I said so I have no luggage no place to stay no food and that’s ok with y’all. I am shocked and here we are 7/10 my daughters birthday stuck in a hotel with only the clothes on our back, no food, no toiletries and all we can do is thank American Airlines for not being willing or accommodating to their customers. I am not the only one affected as that flight that was cancelled on 7/8 out of New Orleans had over 90 passengers who all had to begged American to give them some type of compensation. This is not ok, I am mentally and physically exhausted.   Horrible customer service. We made a family trip to the UK booked through American Airlines for partner British Airways. When we were to return to the States, my husband tested positive for COVID so was not allowed to come home with us. I contacted the airline to rebook his flight for a date after the required isolation and was told I would have to pay the difference in the fares (originally purchased in 2021) which was close to $1000 USD (and even more in GBP). After multiple phone calls to American Airlines to resolve the situation, and not getting anywhere, we used a family member\\'s miles on another airline to get him home. We saved for this trip of a lifetime for quite a while just to lose a good portion of our travel budget due to this airline\\'s refusal to work with its customers.   This was by far the worst trip I have ever had. Like American Airlines have no clue what social distancing means in this pandemic. There was absolutely no social distancing on any of my flights. I was told that the planes were unable to book at 100% during the pandemic? I was told wrong. I sat next to 2 ppl 1 was a little girl whom was coughing and sneezing with no mask on because kids aren’t required to wear one.This was an extreme health risk. The price is not worth me getting sick over had I knew they were performing at 100% capacity I would have never booked.   Will never fly with them again! Seems delaying their flights is consistent for them after reading other reviews. Flight was supposed to leave at 4:45pm we didn\\'t end up leaving until almost 7pm. I wasn\\'t even made aware as to why there was a delay! Also wasn\\'t made aware until getting to the airport in a completely different country that not only was there a delay but that I would not make my 9pm flight to make it home and that there was no other flight available that night and I would have to be stuck in Philadelphia and fly to Boston at 10:30am tomorrow to then make it to my destination not until 4 in the evening the next day! Unbelievable. I did not see anyone else\\'s flights delayed but ours. After being frantic and calling to receive some type of help I didn\\'t get anywhere and absolutely nobody seemed to care! This involved me and several other people as well. Luckily since they are so good at making sure flights are delayed the 9pm was moved to 9:35pm. Me and 10 other passengers rushed/ran as fast as we could to catch the plane to make it home and were able to make it but due to them updating everyone\\'s boarding passes to tomorrow we all had to wait for them to adjust it and find us seats. The plane was not clean at all, no tv\\'s and if you want wifi it\\'s $15 for an hour. I will definitely stick with Delta. What a difference between the two! Arrived back home to find out my bags as well as everyone else\\'s is still stuck in Philadelphia so now I pray and hope those make it back to me! First and last time flying with AA! Never again!  On the whole I think AA\\'s communication is great. Storm Landon was about to blow through Dallas (my connection) and AA warned me a couple of days in advance I may want to consider changing my flights, so I delayed 1 day, but it was still not enough, unfortunately. The flight from MSY to DFW operated, however the next sector to MEX was cancelled due to a cabin crew shortage (pilots and plane were waiting at the gate and baggage was loaded). My bag could not be unloaded and was left on the aircraft overnight and flown to MEX the next day without me. I couldn\\'t get another flight until 2 days later. Overall, all my staff interactions were good, and the cabin and food were good.   I flew from Louisville KY to Dallas TX on August 3. There were 7 in our group, so we bought all except 2 of the 9 seats available in 1st class. I know that 1st class service has diminished on American Airline in the last decade, but this was ridiculous. The flight attendants addressed the 2 men (that were not in our group), appearing to ignore us, maybe because 4 members of our group were minors. But that is the very reason that we paid the outrageous price, to receive special attention for the youngsters. I guess if it had not been for the 2 men that were obviously not part of our group, the flight attendants would have performed as if the 1st class section was empty! They did not address us by name. We had to request snacks and were told, \"we be serving refreshments to everyone later ... just wait\". I got the impression that the cabin crew thought we were invisible. We were on aircraft Canadair CRJ 900. How could American airline charge 1st class fees for those pitiful seats? The seats were narrow, leg room was cramped, even for me who is 5\\' 2\". The only thing that separated our seats from coach was that we were in the front of the plane and that alcohol was included in the price of the tickets (a very expensive Bloody Mary)! The aircraft Canadair CRJ 900 is not designed for 1st class service. If your aircraft is Canadair CRJ 900, opt for the upgraded coach seat (maybe over the wings) and save your money to by a drink when you reach your destination.   American Airlines, I wish to express my extreme disappointment in your airline and customer service. Last month, my family and I boarded your planes for a trip to Hawaii. It was an extremely disappointing experience. Your airline is the least family friendly I have ever met. Most airlines offer pre-boarding for families with small children. This is a great service especially for a family like mine that was traveling with a 1 year old and a 6 year old. I had purchased a seat for my 1 year old so that I would be able to use a car seat. Pre-boarding would have been beneficial to give the time to install a car seat. Please consider making your airline more family friendly with a pre-boarding option. (Especially since seats are assigned.) First, we boarded a severely delayed flight at Salt Lake City International Airport in hopes that we would make our connecting flight in Phoenix. To our dismay we found out that what was supposed to be a 2 hour layover in Phoenix would have to turn into a mad dash to a different terminal and gate to make a flight leaving within minutes of our arrival. If we missed this connection we would have to be retested for COVID. With two small children this was almost impossible. Somehow, it worked. However, after boarding and while trying to install the car seat, the flight attendant yelled at my father who was trying to help me. In fact, her exact words were “You need to sit down. We are not delaying this flight because you won’t take your seat.” When we explained what we were doing she responded with “I don’t care. It is time to take your seat.” She didn’t offer to help. My father complied with her wishes and sat down as I continued to struggle to hold a 1 year old and install a car seat so he could fly safely while we taxied down the runway. I understand that we chose to fly during a global pandemic, and we tried to comply with mask requirements, however, there is no shame in being a decent human being, which some of your flight attendants were not. During the flight my one year began to cough. One of your flight attendants came over and asked where his mask was. I explained that he was under two and not required. To which came the response, “You need to either put a mask on that child or make him stop coughing.” I tried to explain that my 1 year old was simply choking on water, but the flight attendant then cut me off “Look Lady, just mask the kid.” and walked away! This reaction was extremely rude and uncalled for, especially since this flight attendant didn’t wear his mask over his nose as required! I expected more from your customer service. Also, our six year old was napping on the 6 hour flight. When the snack cart came by, my husband simply asked for a drink for when she woke up. The same flight attendant responded with, “I don’t think you are really asking me to waste a drink on a child who won’t wake up. You just want a second drink.” I purchased the seat, which entitled me to a snack whether my child was awake or not! This was only made worse when two rows behind me a man asked for a second can of soda and the flight attendant gave it to him without complaint. This cemented the idea that you are not a family friendly airline! I am never going to fly American Airlines again if I can help it. Nor would I recommend it to any of my friends. I am extremely disappointed in the almost anti-family policies and behaviors of your airline.    I was scheduled to board the flight at 8.25 and eventually arrive at SFO at 12.50AM. This flight was delayed, causing me to miss the connecting flight to SFO, forcing me to layover at Phoenix for 7 hours and then taking me to San Jose instead at 9:14am the next day, forcing me to be late for work. I would need to take another form of transportation from San Jose to my Destination at SFO at my own expense.  I doubt if there could be a worse combination than AA and Miami International but I had had previous experiences so was expecting the worst and that is what I got. The line for business class check in was more than 80, the girl at the check in knew close to nothing, the line to go through Priority security was over 100 and took over 40 minutes although the monitor said a delay of between 8 and 12 minutes. There was one person checking passports and one belt working. Then the long walk and the train to designated gate E2. Shortly before boarding I saw the gate had been changed to E30, more walking and another train. On board no food except packet potato chips or nuts and a can of drink. Then the girl sat down until 10 minutes prior to landing.  Do not waste your time or your money with American Airlines. This airline is not accommodating what so ever. Delayed flights, Cancelled flights. This is our second time flying American with the same issues. You actually pay for certain seats and after you have been cancelled and moved to another flight your seats are no longer valid. \"Hey I paid to sit with my family\" can I be reimbursed\"? NO. Text message you that your flight has been cancelled and reschedule for the next day. \"Wait, Are you all helping with our hotel stay. NO! \"Can you assist with baggage cost? No. We are gonna incur another day of expenses. No cant help with anything. After spending several hours in the airport due to delayed flights, dealing the direct nasty attitudes. I will not be flying with this Airline. Now on a pleasant note we spoke with a a rep her name was Sabah. She was so nice and tried her best to help in any way positive. Yes we asked a lot of questions and she did what she could. Her supervisor was not giving anything or helping with anything.   This airline has the absolute worst customer service that I have ever encountered! This company cares nothing about the customers, and after repeated issues with them over the past four months, I will never fly with them again! Every level of customer service has been terrible, from the airport level to the corporate level. Despite the huge hit the airline industry has takes due to covid, the majority of flights that I have taken with American since September 2020 (approximately 25 flights) have been problematic. They have cancelled countless flights, the staff has been outrageously rude and speaking with a representative is almost impossible. I have had flights cancelled and rescheduled, through no fault or choice of my own, and in doing so have been downgraded from business class and refunded next to nothing. Corporate does nothing and cares only about the financial bottom line, with no thought to the customer experience. Do yourself a favor— save yourself the time, money and stress, and fly with any other airline other than American!   Avoid American Airlines if you cannot risk your flight get delayed or canceled. We will never book this horrible airline again. Our flight get delayed 3 times and then canceled, one time we got on board but had to get off due to mechanical problems. It was all due to mechanical problems but they blamed it to weather. Then, they made it so hard to transfer us to a new flight for next day and offered us a flight 2 days later after waiting in line for 5 hours for customer service. In the end, they made it like they were giving us a favor by offering a next day flight with one stop and 12 hours layover for our direct flight. Horrible experience, never fly with this airline again! I’m sorry if you have flown with American Airlines I feel your pain! Never again! After flying with them I started reading the reviews and to my surprise they were filled with story’s just like mine. I won’t bore you with the details, just know you should steer clear of this airline.   Flying is stressful enough with the masks and the weather. American makes it worse by adding incompetence and indifference to the equation. Think “incompetence” too harsh? First leg delayed over 90 min due to engine tech installing wrong grade of oil. Call it what you want. Rebooked flight delayed an hour for weather, had attendant call gate to ask for hold of five minutes for three more of us, arrived at gate in final minutes, nobody there, door locked, agents came out, indifferent. “We waited long as we could. Sorry” Watched plane sit at jetway another 15 min. Had to get flight to city four hours away and hope for the best, spending night in terminal. No efficiency, every step slow, jetway driver slow. Just poorly run at every phase.   This issue with American airlines refers to European Country Passport holders flying to Spain with American Airlines from Washington Dulles Airport. I was denied check-in from a flight in Dulles on May, 13th 22. I am a frequent flyer and had all valid documents to travel to Spain; if you are a European passport holder (German, Italian, French etc...) flying to Spain, you only need your up-to-date EU Health pass and your passport nowadays. For some reasons, the ground staff did not get the memo and denied me boarding as they kept asking for the Spanish health form to be handed in over. Airlines can offer that option to fill in the form on board even if the form will be of no use. On top of that, the Dulles airport offers a 2G internet network coverage which makes it extremely hard to download or even access any foreign government websites from your mobile. I was then \\'obliged\\' to book another flight that same day as that issue was not solvable on the spot with that ground staff. I lost money and time because of their incompetence.   This was the only time I’ve flown with American Airlines and it will be my last. Each flight to and from my destination they delayed our flight until a day. They were not helpful at all for helping switch and change my flight, which was there fault. The staff was rude beyond belief. One of the ladies made me check my carry on when I’ve never had a problem with it. And have always made it through every airport and flight with it. I’m sitting in my seat right now just livid. I’ll never fly American again. It was the most stressful and awful flights I’ve ever experienced   Worst customer service experience I’ve ever had. They re-routed our flight to refuel without notifying us, causing us to be stuck on the plane for 5 and a half hours without food except pretzels, and the delay made us miss our connecting flight home. When asked what we should do, the flight attendant looked me up and down and told me to run (I’m 6 months pregnant and traveling with a toddler).There were no other available flights to get us home that day, so we had to get a rental car and drive for hours. When I tried to call customer service I was told multiple times that I need to send an email because no one actually works in customer relations and that no one would help me. I was given a laughable amount of “trip credits”, which I am unable to use and asked if I could have my money back for the flight they caused us to miss. I was told I was lucky to even get flight credits and that they wouldn’t help me any further. Everyone I spoke to, including supervisors, had an extremely hostile attitude. On the actual flight the Wi-Fi wouldn’t work, my tv screen didn’t work and it was extremely hot on the plane.   This is the most horrible airline I’ve ever flown with. I used to fly with them all the time I will never fly with them again, the only good thing was the ticket agent in Phoenix helped me out. Everybody else was rude, the ticket agent in Dallas Fort Worth was absolutely rude. We booked a flight my husband and I for vacation and they booked us in separate areas of the plane. I mean he’s in the very front and I’m in the very back. When I tried to address it they told me I had to pay them more money. That’s absolutely ridiculous that I have to pay more money to sit by my husband on a plane flight that we booked together.    The absolute worst way to travel. Everything about our experience has been terrible. Our flight was delayed 16 hours and when talking to workers, they were incredibly rude and basically said oh well. It then took us several hours just to get a flight to a destination that we have had planned for months. Several of my classmates have been up since three am and it is currently 10:35. We were then all split up (as a group of 20) to go to different locations (Philadelphia, Boston, new jersey, Chicago). Once my mom, me, and two other students got our ticket, the lady told us that the boarding process had already started, so we had to rush to our next plane. They gave us two meal vouchers each, but several of them were expired. Once I arrived in Charlotte, the team members continued to be rude! A lady did not speak English and she was reprimanded for boarding with group 8, even though her ticket said group 8. Once on the plane, I sat next to a lady who told me that when she arrived at the airport, she was told that she had canceled her flight and then she had to start her ticket process all over. Once I arrived in the Boston airport, we were told that we were lied to by Orlando American airlines about a hotel voucher being booked for us when we were sent to a completely different state. We have now been waiting for over an hour for a hotel that was supposed to be booked several hours ago. When we asked the front desk, the lady continued to be on her phone while not even answering us when we asked what hotels were around when we were willing to pay with our own money, for a hotel. While waiting, a lady came up with a broken suitcase and all five members at the desk sat there, several of them on their phones, while she had a suitcase with a broken wheel. They barely moved while she had to pick up the suitcase to show them. I do not understand how not a single person has done the right thing. Everyone is completely rude in the process, even though they were the ones who messed up. I am never using American Airlines again. They have ruined a trip planned out a year in advance.   They make you check your carry on items if boarding last only to get on the aircraft to see 5-10 empty bins. Every time I fly with them there is always some sort of delay which when connecting flights can cause a missed flight or with paid parking can cause extra charges. For what they charge all these things should be avoided. This is not a one time thing. It is literally every time I use them. Honestly I have better luck with cheaper airlines like frontier and spirit in terms of being on time and bag availability.   Worst flight I have ever flown. Delayed flight 30 minutes for people who were connecting from another flight. All but 2 people who arrived had food and drinks in their hands. We really waited a half hour for people who couldn\\'t wait an hour and fifteen minutes to land in Philadelphia. I could understand waiting a couple minutes but a half hour is ridiculous. I have work early in the morning and am losing sleep cause of this decision. Also I could not even enjoy my seat because I sat next to a person who took up almost 2 seats.   On 09/09/2023, I had a ticket Flight from Miami (MIA Airport) to New York City (LGA), number 1389 departuring at 08:40 PM. However the flight got cancelled with no reason or explanation. After several attempts to contact the American Airlines Customer Services by phone, after waiting for more than 30 minutes the calls got hung up on me, the chat on line service kept saying the same answer over and over, that they could not help because they were limited and there was no flights available until two days after. Finally, after 3 hours on a huge line at the airport customer service, they put me on a waiting list for the following day, with no guarantee that I can fly and should spend the whole day at the airport trying. On top of that, my luggage was sent to La Guardia/ NYC, so they didn\\'t provide accommodation in any hotel, I didn\\'t have my clothes with me, and had the worst experience ever. They said the flight got canceled due to issues with the weather which is not true, because both the weather in Miami and New York were perfect fine. There\\'s no respect or empathy with their customers.   Worst experience of my life. My flight gets canceled so I go to the front desk to find an alternate route. The agent at the front desk is so rude and threatens to fight me twice. She gets mad that my friend and I booked our flights separately, but came in together to get our flights figured out. She is so rude that we are booked separately even though we both have our confirmation codes and information ready. We have all of our travel information ready and can prove it right then. She never tells us options until she hands us our boarding pass. She said \"oh you don\\'t have you\\'re stuff right now, we are going to fight.\" We had our stuff in our cars, since it was 12 pm and we thought our earliest flight we could get was at 6 pm. Then when we are pulling up our information, apparently we are taking too long or something and she said \"yeah this is why we are going to fight.\" I was never rude or anything, just trying to get this figured out for our trip, when it was American\\'s fault we could not get our flight. If that is who American is hiring to represent themselves, they should not even be a company that exists anymore. Then on our way home, we keep getting notified that our flight is delayed because \"people need to get off the plane\" even though the plane has been there for hours and no one else is getting off or got off before we boarded. Will never fly American again. They are such a joke.    Worst airline by far, please I repeat please never fly with this company! A one hour delay turned into a almost 6 hour delay. Terminal employees misinform or are not informed themselves, the lack of professionalism in the we were rudely treated. Never again.   I booked a business trip from West Palm Beach to Philadelphia on March 7th. I had to cancel my flight when the business meeting was cancelled due to the COVID crisis more than a month before the trip. I was expecting a refund on my next credit card statement, but none was forthcoming. When I contacted American Airlines to request a refund, I was told there would be none. In a calm voice I said that this would influence my choice of carriers the next time I flew...she hung up on me! I will never fly American Airlines again,   Connecting flight from Alaska Airlines, which is partnered with American. Alaska arranged this flight for me. I had checked in online with both Alaska and American 24 hours prior. I had printed my boarding passes and baggage ticket from kiosk in Santa Rosa airport. When I get to Los Angeles, and go to American Eagle gate, I am told the boarding pass was not the right pass. I was then asked for my passport, as I was listed as an \\'international traveler\\', for no apparent reason. I explained I did not have my passport, that I had not flown outside the country. I was then asked where I was flying from Denver, and I explained Denver was my home destination. This required multiple conferences with their co-worker, and a few phone calls. Finally allowed on plane for my first class seat, one of the last to board. This was a needless delay, and made no sense to anyone. Not only that, but my suitcase did not transfer even though the baggage ticket plainly stated it was to go to Los Angeles and then to Denver. It stayed in Los Angeles, and has been to North Carolina and back in the past day. Very bad connecting flight experience, I wish Alaska did not partner with American. Also, other minor annoyances; when I arrived at the first gate for transfer to American Eagle, I was not aware the doors would open and I would be herded on to a bus, even though I had gone to the counter agent earlier to make sure I was at the correct gate. It\\'s not a problem if only someone there had mentioned to me the routine. As it was, I was confused and inwardly doubting I was in the right area as everyone else on the bus seemed to be going to Portland. A simple explanation would have gone a long way with me late at night in an unfamiliar setting. Another minor annoyance: I was not aware that the Admiral lounge was only for first class passengers that were on \\'flagship\\' airplanes, and not for American Eagle. No where on the website had I read that (maybe I didn\\'t see it), and instead had the impression that Alaska Airlines first class passengers were also able to use the \\'partner\\' American Airlines Admiral lounge. Disappointing, as this first class ticket was a bit of a treat for me and not how I usually travel. I really do not like flying American Airlines.   The worst first class experience in my 53 years of flying across the globe. Fours late and no reasons or apologies. Meals and wine in First Class were abysmal. Even after all that frustration, I couldn\\'t get a glass of their champagne down. Never will I fly these people again.   Nashville to Montreal via NYC / Charlotte. This is my second trip within 6 months with American Airlines and I\\'m disgusted. My first trip was taken in August of 2019 (same route BNA->Montreal) and between 3 aircraft issues and 5 delayed flights, which caused missed connections, what t was suppose to be a 5hr trip into a 24 hour one with delayed baggage (I received my luggage the next day after calling all night). My second time flying with this airline (I honestly don\\'t know why they are still in business). The first flight had engine oil issues .. but they kept us in there while they fixed it. Between that and other issues, we were delayed for 3 hours while seated in the flight. Then, they reassured us that connections would not be missed, because it\\'s winter and everyone is delayed. We made it from Nashville, TN to Charlotte, NC, missed the connection (go figure), and put on another connection through LGA (NYC). Flight delayed (again). This time because they were waiting on the flight attendants (seems like the same sequence of excuses used 6 months ago) and when we arrived in NYC missed the connection.  I go see customer service, and they inform me that the next (and last) flight of the day, was full. But they put me on\" Priority\" Standby. I went to the gate 4 hours early, 2 hours before the flight, gate changed. Went to the changed gate 2 hours early and waited. When their agents arrived at the desk I explained my situation and asked them to verify if there was space, the guy at the counter told me this \"You\\'re on standby and you will be the last one to board\". I told him that I understood this, but I was also placed on \"Priority standby\" and he replies \"well, they might have told you that at the other desk, but you\\'re not important enough to be on priority standby. There are currently 8 people who are more important and they\\'ve been placed in from of you .. you\\'re number 8., the last person and the flight is full, so good luck!\". I bought my ticket, it was never a standby ticket. This type of ugliness and unprofessional behavior is uncalled for. In the brink of tears I waited. The flight boarded and I watched it leave without me. Went back to the desk to be given a viable solution and conveniently enough, their computers were frozen. I sat down in the area and waited (18hrs spent in the airport ), I turned around a few minutes later and They had all left.  I bought a greyhound ticket and road 8 hours into Montreal (with my checked luggage still in North Carolina). A hellish and nightmarish experience, for the second time. Shame on me for even wasting my trust on this airline. Flight attendants have horrible attitudes, agents are rude and curt, and customer service is zero help. And the cherry on top was the unmitigated gall of that agent to talk to any person the way he did to me. Take this airline at your own risk, should you want your sanity tested. As for me, never again.   Had 6 flights(including connectors) in a 48 hour period. Only 1 flight on time - average delay more than 1 hour and one leg cancelled totally because they did not have a pilot. Lost the prepaid hotel in Newport,RI at cost — wedding! Should have been there in time but no pilot! This was not weather related — AA selling tickets without adequate staffing. I personally emailed the CEO of AA because he promised to turn AA around and sited to include enough employees - has not happened. If you expect to get to a destination, don’t fly AA. If you are okay being delayed; addressed rudely by gate agents, provided vouchers for hotel when flights cancelled and no one at the hotel answers a call to pick you up, then do fly AA and you will not be disappointed. If you enjoy spending hours upon hours in an airport waiting to go standby only to learn that the gate agents messed up and took passengers below you on the standby list, fly AA. If you fly for more than an 1.5 hours (no weather issues) and are not offered even a water or package of crackers, fly AA If you reach out to customer service voicing complaints that a gate agent was rude and threatening and their response is to offer a voucher for a future 1/16th the cost of my flight, fly AA.  This is one awful airline. They don\\'t appear to do any maintenance on their planes. We taxied out, hung around for two hours and then returned to the hangar because of an engine issue. Slow service at the gates to get a hotel for the night. The flight was scheduled for 10am the next morning. After we got to the airport and through security, we were told the flight was now leaving at 7pm. We could have at least slept in if we had been told this earlier. Then at 5.30pm, the new boarding time, we were told the engine was fixed and now there was a hydraulics issue and no part to fix it with. Apparently they were getting another airplane into service to replace this one with no ETA. As to why this was not done earlier is anyone\\'s guess. Still stuck at the airport with no end in sight. Don\\'t fly American. They are a rubbish company.   I had a pair of very comfortable, punctual flights between La Guardia New York and Nashville. Outbound to Nashville, I was in economy class in an aisle seat towards the front. It had more leg space and the seat to my left was unocuppied. The seat layout was 2 by 2. So I did not feel confined at all. Two snacks and a beverage were offered on the 90 minute flight. There was sufficient storage space above to stash my roll on carry on suitcase and my top coat. Arrival and deboarding at Nashville was smooth and efficient. On the return, I was pleased to find myself upgraded to business class at the gate. The flight was relatively light in occupancy. The business class seat was comfortable with considerable leg space. Flight attendant was very gracious and hung up in the closet both my top coat and suit jacket, returning them just before landing. Plane arrived at La Guardia several minutes before schedule. On the flight, liquor and some light snacks were offered in addition to a dirnk on boarding. There was no entertainment system on this aircraft though wi-fi was available which I did not avail of. All in all, it was a stress-free, pleasant travel experience.   My experience with American was pretty bad. The woman who sat next to me had her mask completely down for 80% of the flight, was eating candy and sucking on her fingers. She also put her carry-on bag in the seat between us. None of the flight attendants checked to see if our bags were under our seats or if masks were being won correctly. I was definitely exposed sitting next to this woman, (who was also sniffling and coughing), definitely won’t be booking any more flights with AA.   American Airlines they do not practice social distancing. COVID is not a factor. Passengers on flight no mask on and one was coughing. Never made aware you book full flights. Money should not be a factor when it comes to people’s lives. 2 to a seat on each end should be the safe practice not 3. Never will fly this airline again. I was with wheelchair assistance and noone came until after the aircraft was completely empty with not even the crew. I had to start walking. Wheelchair assistance was called 3 times. Unbelievable! Your customer service is awful! We wonder why we can’t recover from Pandemic. No one adheres to protect.   We were flying from Jacksonville, FL to Portland, ME. Our departing flight from JAX was delayed and when we asked gate attendants about our connection, they were extremely rude to us and told us that everyone would be making their connections. We did not, our connection left while we were still on the plane in CLT. We went straight to AA customer service when we got off the place in CLT and asked about our options for getting home to PWM. There were no other flights going there that night, so we were told we could either stay the night and fly out the next day or we could fly into Manchester, NH and our car rental from there to PWM would be covered. I asked the agent for her name and if I needed a claim number for the rental coverage and she told me to just go online and file the claim and that I didn\\'t need anything else. After our rental I did just as she instructed me to and after going through four people at customer relations and customer service was told that our car rental would not be covered. Extremely disappointed, we are long time AA credit card holders and flyers. I will not be using AA anymore in the future for my frequent travels. Extremely disappointed and angry as I now have a $350 car rental bill.  Little Rock to Fort Lauderdale. This has been the most unprofessional experience I have ever had on any airline including Spirit! How are you worst than Spirit? Here is a summary of my trip with this unorganized airline. I am a young woman traveling with 4 children. Once I reached my gate I was told that due to weather the flight was delayed. I was not given any assistance in figuring out an alternative option. I was advised to stay on the flight and find my own hotel accommodations in the connecting city. I found another flight in the same airport to get me to my connecting flight in time. Once I reached my destination I was told that my 1 year car seat was never boarded on the flight. I checked the car seat at the check in counter. My son could not commute on our vacation without a car seat, therefore neither could I. Huge inconvenience! On my return flight, it was delayed again and there was no option. I had to leave the airport with children after I\\'ve made it to the gate and return the next morning. I get back home to find that my car seat is missing. This has been the worst experience. To make matters worst, not only does this airline not care about the safety of children, they could care less about my concerns. I have emailed the customer service department twice with no response. I will not recommend this airline for any family.   American Airlines needs to get fully informed on the BS new mask mandate. They claim double cloth, but no gaiters. They claim following CDC. CDC shares that if a gaiter is used that it should be folded into two layers to comply. AA can’t seem to understand this. I flew all week with no issues. First segment on 2/4/21 from FLL to CLT No issues. But these idiots from CLT to DAY just couldn’t comprehend that their information is incorrect. Study up AA and make your policies more detailed because as a weekly traveler I sure was able to shred holes in your written policy using your own policy.  American Airlines has the very worst customer service. I booked a flight from Denver to Dublin with a connecting flight in Charlotte. I only had a 35 minute layover so I asked the gate and the flight attendant if this would be a problem. They assured me I would make it. Then we sat on the tarmac in Charlotte for 30 minutes. I ran through the airport to catch my flight but they had already shut the door. Nobody bothered to phone ahead and ask them to hold the door for 2 minutes. Waited in line at customer service to book another flight. They said they could only get me on a flight from Dulles. Spent the night in Charlotte and they flew me to Dulles the next morning. When I got to Dulles, the flight was overbooked and they didn’t have a seat for me. Had to spend the night in Dulles. American would not pay for my hotel stay. They booked me on a 10pm flight the next day. They made no effort to compensate me. Correction, they offered me 2500 miles. I can get more than that by simply applying for a credit card. They haven’t offered to allow me access to the Admiral Club while I wait in the airport for 9 hours. They would not upgrade my seat. Nothing. The short story: I have spent 3 days trying to get to Dublin and I’m still not there.    This airline had the worst customer service, all of the flight attendants and workers were extremely rude, and borderline verbally harassed me because I did not return his \"hello\" quick enough. He then asked if I knew how to speak because only people who could talk were allowed on the plane. I was very offended and walked past trying to play it off as funny, then he continued to chirp at me as I walked onto the boarding deck. Not only did out first flight get delayed because they \"overfueled\" the plane, then out second flight got delayed for \"mechanical issues\" and then continued to keep us stranded on the plane with no AC. I will never fly this airline again. I don\\'t know if it is a problem with DFW or American Airlines but I have never felt so uncomfortable flying in my entire life.  Miami to Phoenix. Charge people for 2 seats if they are fat. Skinny people should not have to deal with others obesity or at least put seats in from this decade that are human sizes from this time period. Seriously? 1 soda for no AC on the plane? The fans suck I\\'ve been sweating the whole plane ride. If i didn’t have to for my work I would rather pay the gas because this is the definition of torture.   So unprofessional and rude customer service! I had a flight from san Antonio to Paris with layover in Dallas, the first flight was delayed hour and half in san Antonio and i asked the agent that it\\'s better i reschedule my connection - she said no you will be fine they will delay it anyway, which did not end up happening and i missed my connection. I was going to take another route from Dallas to London to Paris but because of how unhelpful and rude the agents are i went to AA customer assistance and they literally threw my passport in my face and sent me away saying go to British Airways to check you in which when i did. They said that since AA changed your flight they are responsible to issue a ticket number so i went back to AA - they sent me away for the 2nd time saying we can\\'t help you and did not even give me any sort of information and not answering my questions. Because of them i missed my 2nd flight and they said you will have to take the next day flight which i had no choice but to take it, they refused to book me an hotel or a cab till i insisted. Not to mention that there were 6 agents on the counters just laughing and chit chatting and joking and made a line wait for 2+ hours and they can see everyone frustrated and they were not helpful to anyone. And after all this they lost my luggage I\\'ve been waiting for it for 3 days and i did a claim but can\\'t get a hold of anyone for assistance since they never answer phones or emails for 3 days. Never would fly with them again and never recommend it to anyone.   The flight from BNA to Dallas wasn’t fully booked and yet, for some reason, we were all crammed in the back. First of all, middle seats should not be sold as we’re in the middle of a pandemic. The flight attendant saw that passengers could be split up so middle seats could be left open and we could all social distance a bit better, but no, they just left it how it was. On top of that, the flight from BNA to Dallas was delayed because the airport was closed to incoming flights due to heavy fog. We were told that our flight to QRO would be fine and that we would make it. Nope. It left without us and didn’t even care that 4 passengers were missing because they’re previous flight was delayed due to airport closure. To make it even better, two of our bags didn’t make the Dallas to QRO flight. We were told that our bags would be sent the following day on another flight and that they would be put in a taxi and sent to our house. I have just called American Airlines in QRO and they said the bags haven’t been put in the taxi yet. The flight had been landed over two hours at that point. Why do I have to call the airline multiple times to make sure they’re doing their job. Mind you, the contents of the bag are almost all of the nice clothes I own, as well as my medication that I absolutely need. I have never in my life had such an inconsistent and poor experience with any airline such. Put your money elsewhere, like Southwest. I will never fly with this airline again. They do not care about their customers, they have terrible customer service and are a poor excuse for an airline.   Worst experience ever, terrible customer service flight delayed more than 9+ hours and they keep postponing departure. No clear reason on why all this is happening everyone frustrated, seat was not clean when I boarded and luggage not onboard captain is saying another 45 min extra to finish. Seriously how can they be this bad? Please don’t fly with AA, fly with someone else!  Out of 4 flights, 3 delayed, luggage delayed 7 hours. The delay into DFW caused a missed connection and overnight stay. No customer service from American. They did offer a hotel stay at the Motel 6 or Super 8, no thank you. (Do you think they put there crew in those hotels?) There was no compensation for all these delays. My problem is not with the delays, I know that happens. My problem is with the poor customer service. I will reluctantly be going back to Delta.   Worst experience ever first change my flight to 2 hours later one with a stop in Miami instead of Charlotte which makes me more far from Newark then after boarding and staying inside the plane for 2 hours bring us back to a gate. Then keep delaying 20 minutes, then 20 minutes till midnight, then cancel the flight. We have to stand in customer service line to rebook. The line was 5 gates long and not really good alternative. Most people have to stand in the line for 2 hours to get a flight for next day and no hotel or meal was provided. I had to book for next morning with United airlines. Never American Airlines again.   This review refers more to American\\'s refund policy than the actual flight I took. I find it an airline like most of the rest with little interest in the customer. No better, no worse than the other major US airlines. I do find their $60 fee for first bag excessive. Because of covid the airlines are trying to attract customers by offering lenient cancellation terms. I want people to know that American\\'s terms include the following as I recently had to cancel a trip due to covid. This is what I found in my particular case, but I suggest any flyer should check their situation before booking. 1) The cancellation fee in my situation was $200 per ticket. This can add up if you are flying with multiple people. 2) I had the option to change my dates at no charge, but if you booked at a higher rate, you get no refund if your follow up trip is less. 3) You can get a voucher towards future travel (as they call it) implying that you have the full fare to use as you want. Your travel must be completed prior to the date you originally purchases the tickets. So in other words, if you purchased your Christmas tickets early say, July and you cancel. You have to complete our trip prior to July in order to use the voucher. It should, be like for like, either you book within one year of your original booking date or you need to complete travel by the end date of the cancelled reservation. 4) In addition to this restriction the small print tells you that this voucher is only good for one trip and only for the original passengers. So if you had a trip to Europe scheduled for $2000 for you and your husband and you want to fly with your daughter to visit another daughter in the US. You would need to pay for your daughter\\'s ticket and you would lose the balance of the voucher which will probably be in excess of $1000. I understand that the airlines are in tight straights but they can do something more to help passengers with rescheduling flights.   Awful service. Our flight got delayed for hours and then when they finally get us on an airplane the pilots leave and they tell us we have to find new pilots? They didn’t offer us customers any kind of drink or anything for this terrible inconvenience and I know I speak for everyone on this flight currently (cause I’m still here waiting for the pilots!) when I say this is a huge let down and disappointment.   Plane had not taken off yet, was set to depart at 4:32pm. I arrived at 4:12pm and the lady at the gate said sorry gate is closed and allow 3 stand by passengers to go In front of me. It’s not now 4:35pm and I have already walked down by B28 and received a new ticket to depart at 8:08PM. Last time flying American. Terrible service. Always go Delta!   American airlines over booked my flight and offered me 300 to change. I called in to do so and they charged $246 instead. They just lost an executive platinum member. To add insult to injury when I called back to discuss why I was over charged after the airport could have done it for \"free\". I was told I was charged because I called. Stay far away from this company and their bad business practices.  On September 26, 2023. I was flying out from Austin to Indianapolis. This was a round trip ticket. I had my 17 lbs 2-year-old miniature poodle with me. I have used the same pet carrier for a number of years, and this will probably be my fourth flying with my dog on American Airlines. Within the last 2 years. The American Airline agent, told me that my dog carrier was too large, and he was not going to check him in. I told him that this was a round trip ticket on the same airline and we had no issues flying out from Indianapolis. Instead of listening, he stopped looking at me and stated that he was not going to check the dog as he walked away to get his supervisor. The supervisor came back with a measuring tape and told me that it was too large. She then asked me to tell my dog on command to turn around in the carrier. I explained to her that I cannot make my dog turn around in the pet carrier on common. They then stated that my dog needed to be under 16 lbs to fly. This also isn’t the policy on their website, the dog needs to be under 20 lbs. I had to say, “will you please listen to me. I flew round trip on American, this was not an issue. I again, explained to both of them that this is not my first time flying with my dog, and that I am a physician and I need to get back so I could go to work tomorrow.” The supervisor then asked me for my record locator. By this time, another supervisor was on the phone with the 1st supervisor and stated that they can allow for me to take my dog. The supervisor then told me that I got lucky this time and to buy another carrier. She then stated to me they have different protocols at other airports but in Austin they follow the rules. I said to her that you are telling me that the AA ticket agents in Philadelphia, Kentucky, both Chicago airports and Indianapolis were all wrong, but the two of you were the only ones who were correct? He proceeds to tell me stories of dogs in baby carriages that he had to turn away. I told him, that I do not have a pet baby carriage, I have a carrier that I have used repeatedly without an issue until today. He handed me my ticket and I left. American Airline carrier requires: 18x11x11 (length +width+ height) My pet carrier 16.1 x 11.8 x 14 I fly frequently with my miniature poodle. I have the AMEX platinum card and I listed American Airlines as my carrier in order to receive points and I truly regret this decision, since I cannot change my carrier for another year. There is truly no such thing as customer service when it comes to these Airlines. American is no better then any of the others.   First of all, the check in area was absolute chaos. No organization what so ever. The security was so confined and crowded which made me feel very uncomfortable and that they don’t care about COVID guidelines. They told me that I couldn’t bring my carry on bag onto the airline because it was “full” but when I got to the plane, there were plenty of open overhead bins. I am in a huge rush for a work meeting after this flight and I am so upset that I was lied to and had to check my bag. It has just been a horrible experience and I will never fly American Airlines ever again.  Booked first flight to specifically have ZERO issues to board with my guitar for work. Was given a hard time about overhead space when it was able to fit in the regional airplane. Have done this for MANY MANY flights for work with no issues. This is the first time in the many years I\\'ve been traveling and touring that they would give me that hard of a time. Was able to fit it no problem after they gave me attitude about it in the first place. American Airlines used to be one of my favorite airlines to travel up until everything happened with the lockdowns in 2020. It is more than likely that unless I am not traveling with my instrument for work, I will most likely never fly with them again. It is against the law to not allow my instrument to be carried on.   Why is American Airlines always looking for ways to screw their frequent flyer miles holders? I used to fly a lot on American but could never use the miles I earned because of all their restrictions. Fours years ago I decided to give them another chance. Two years ago we had our annual trip to a Sandals planned and had to cancel due to Covid-19. At the time we had reserved two round trip tickets from Phoenix. When I went to re-book as covid conditions were improving, strangely the miles that purchase two round trip tickets could only purchase one now. Okay, things happened, so I used twice the miles and booked the flights, but could not assign seats on the way back. Okay, I guess no one could. Another couple decided to go with us so he purchased two tickets and he was able to get assigned seats for all four flights. If I tried to claim a seat, I could only purchase an upgraded seat. 2 * $69. My friend sitting next to me in the airport, login to AA.com could change his seat to any number of open seats in coach. Why is AA always looking for a way to screw their frequent flyer miles holders?  I fly a lot. I’ve flown 3-5 times a year domestically and internationally for most of my life. I’ve had many horrible experiences with planes - delays, cancelled flights, etc. But, I’ve never experienced the absolute disaster that is American Airlines. It’s not the service. It’s the physical planes. My first flight COU to IAH was delayed due to mechanical issues (which they blamed on cold weather which the pilot told us wasn’t true- disgusting behavior by the airline). We were strung along for several hours that a rescue plane was coming. By the time they said we should rebook, all the decent flights were no longer an option. I would’ve had to fly to Dallas late then Houston the next morning. Family ended up driving 4 hours to pick me up because the airline wouldn’t give me a hotel voucher. I flew out of COU 13 hours late (the plane I was rebooked on was delayed as well). Flying home, I left from BTR and that flight was also delayed due to mechanical issues. We left 5 hours late. I missed my connection to COU, so was stuck in Dallas for 10 hours waiting for my flight. No food vouchers of course because it ‘wasn’t their fault’. My plane to COU was then delayed again. I didn’t get home until we’ll after 1am. I was supposed to be home before noon. I had to be up for work at 4am. Zero apologizes from the airline besides ‘sorry for the inconvenience but maintenance isn’t our problem’. Yes maintenance is your problem. The number of planes with mechanical issues I had makes me very reluctant to ever fly with this airline again. They can’t maintain their planes. They don’t notice issues until their passengers are about to board- and these are first flight of the day planes too. There’s plenty of time to check the plane after a flight to be ready for the next day. In my line of work, not checking your equipment would lead to people being fired. Maybe that needs to start happening in aviation. It’s not hard to check the plane after a flight. And if your planes are breaking down this frequently, maybe there’s a bigger problem. Also the complete lack of support for passengers being stranded (many people I flew with were forced to get hotel rooms and the airline offered zero help) is appalling. I’m in the service industry. I’d never dream of treating people like this. I won’t be flying American Airlines again.   One thing I’ve noticed over the years - some, not all, but some of the crew are simply insolent. I am absolutely not ageist, but the sighs and groans and rolling of the eyes tend to come from the older crew, it’s now too much for them so they get upset when you politely make a reasonable request, like ask for something. One older crew member was rude to me, not badly but you just wouldn’t say certain remarks to someone who’s perhaps paid quite a bit of money for a business class cabin. Years ago, a company executive said to me that if the bosses don’t know what’s going on, they can’t do anything about it. No welcome drink. No breakfast. Lazy. Should get a part refund to be fair. Gate staff at Miami were disrespectful.   We bought the tickets through Expedia at a low price and I\\'ve found out why. Most of the American Airline planes are old and need maintenance, causing constant delays. The also cancel flights often, likely because the flight wasn\\'t full. I was scheduled to leave Kansas at 4pm, but they canceled the flight and moved me to a 12 pm flight. In that flight, the plane was old, and we were delayed 30 minutes because a door to the overhead compartment wouldn\\'t shut. I then had a 4 hour layover at Dallas due to the flight cancelation. Not only that, but the flight to take me back to Atlanta at 6:30 was also delayed 2 hours because of maintenance. If I wanted to spend 12 hours waiting, I would\\'ve driven. American Airlines is cheap for a reason and not worth the inevitable delays, do not book here!   My flight was scheduled to leave at 7:17 am. Since I am supposed to get to the airport 1.5-2 hours before the flight, I was up early and arrived at 5:15am. At 5:36 am I received a notification from American that this flight was delayed until 9:45am because of \"logistical issues\". As a result I missed my connecting flight. I was supposed to get into Little Rock for 11:15am and now have a connecting flight putting me in little rock for 8:26pm. Having read the reviews on American Airlines before booking this flight, I should have heeded the warnings. Lesson learned! Wanted to give American Airlines a chance to prove the reviews wrong. I was wrong, American lives up to its subpar reviews. Because of \"logistical issues\" rearrange my transportation, reservations and housing. I have never flown American before and will never fly them again.  I tried to call American Airlines and was on hold for 36 minutes. Never got to talk to a person.  I fly 6 times a year on average, United, Delta, Jet Blue have been seamless. American is in the bottom tier for a reason, great way to put yourself out of business.   First, let me start this off by saying, in the past, I typically did choose American Airlines whenever possible, now, moving on, I will not be choosing AA. I ordered tickets for a wedding that was to occur on January 2nd, and my flight was supposed to be December 26th. On December 21st, I woke up with chills and couldn\\'t taste my food all that well. I decided to get a rapid covid-19 test and it came back positive.  The day I received my results, I cancelled my flight, giving AA 5 days to rebook the flight if necessary. I then requested a refund through the website, and provided proof of my positive result. Although it was the cheaper ticket, which is apparently non-refundable, refunds are available (supposedly) due to medical reasons. I received notice that the refund was not going to be unavailable. I called, to which I ended up talking to someone in reservations. They advised me they could not help me and told me to contact customer service through the website or through \\'snail mail\\', as she referred to it as, I let her know I wanted to actually TALK to someone, not go back and forth through e-mails, or wait on the post. She told me that simply wasn\\'t possible. I asked for a copy of the recording, which she told me, I was unable to receive... even though I\\'m a part of that conversation and was not told I was being recorded, I just assumed it. This is very greedy of a company to do, considering I gave notice ASAP, and their guidelines wouldn\\'t have allowed me to fly with them Covid-positive anyways. Take this as you will, but be wary -- and make sure to give into the greed of spending extra money on \\'refundable\\' ticket should you choose to fly American Airlines, because their greed knows no sympathy, and no exception and should something far out of your control occur.   Agent was very rude and disrespectful. He got upset and threw my luggage. I was denied a Manager and the Supervisor stated that Corporate management wouldn\\'t talk to customers even if she did call. They had no concern about damaging my belongings nor any remorse for throwing it. It was clear that no disciplinary action would be taken against agent. It was like the behavior was condoned. American Airline service was a complete horror show and even if the airline ticket was a dollar I wouldn\\'t fly again. As I sit in this airport awaiting board all I can do is wonder about my luggage praying that they don\\'t do any further damage to my belongings or purposely lose it. Supervisor threaten me and said if I posted on the internet I would never fly with American Airline again although I plan on never flying with them again.   Washington to Raleigh Durham. Every single time I take American I am forced to check my carry on. My carry on is not over sized and is actually very small. And every single time I get on the air craft there are over 5 fully empty buns above the seats that are available. This is becoming a serious reason as to why I will no longer take American. I’ll pay more to take other airlines because you obviously don’t care about all of your customers. I mean you aren’t even allowing mid level customers to bring on their luggage as carryons. I’m so over this.   They have an app but it is sub par. Didn\\'t update gate changes, causing me to miss my connection. I haven\\'t been home in a month, but thanks to AA, that\\'ll be a month and a day. I never had this problem with Delta (my preferred airline). AA is cheaper, but I can see clearly, it\\'s for obvious reasons.   Absolutely incompetent flight coordinator and grounds crew management! Last three times to Austin Airport, we sat on the tarmac for 30min waiting for a gate. Then we have to wait an hour + for our baggage claim   Customer service at the Savannah airport with American Airlines are absolutely unprofessional and rude to travelers. The lady that was helping me caused me to miss my flight and she wouldn’t even accommodate to me on a flight that would be convenient for me. She was training and was very slow at what she was doing on her computer. I had never experienced something this terrible with an airline and never expected this from American Airlines   Infuriation experience! My family of 5 arrived at the Knoxville airport at approximately 4;00 am for our 6;00 am flight. We arrived to see a massive crowd of what looked like students checking in with large crates for each student to check in. After standing in line for approximately 45 minutes with no movement in the line at all, I walked up to 1st class and asked if they could help us get checked in. We told the 1st lady that we had been trying to check in through the kiosk but 2 of the 3 were malfunctioning (the staff knew about it). She told me I would need to get back in line. When I went to the front of the line for the 2nd time to tell them we needed to get checked in for our flight, we were told there was no way we were going to make our flight. I begged them to get us on the flight. I told them there were 5 of us traveling together, their kiosks were broken, and we were there in plenty of time but they were not about to help us. I was told by 4 separate AA employees that this is what they do every single day because they are so short staffed. I told them it was my son\\'s 16th birthday and we had a surprise party gathering at our home that evening but they could have cared less. I pled with them and they didn\\'t even pretend to care. I asked them to look at the security cameras to see how early we arrived but they wouldn\\'t do a thing to help us. I ended up having to rent another car and 2 hotel rooms because of AA\\'s complete lack of customer concern or ability to do their job adequately because of their lack of staff. I am beyond disappointed and have thought about this every day since this event.  We booked first class from BUF to CLT and CLT to IAD. They changed our seats for our first flight but that’s ok because it seems they have to accommodate a senior disable person, what’s unacceptable is changing our seats again for our connecting flight from CLT to IAD 4 times and ended up downgraded. Do not book from this airline, you’ll waste your money.   The worst experience ever! Our flight was from Miami to Fresno with a connecting flight in Dallas. The flight from Miami left late which made us late to our connecting flight. The plane left us! We were put on different planes back home because they didn\\'t have enough seats for all of us on the same flight until the next day! All we got was a “sorry”. Even our new flights were delayed! Their customer service and flight attendants are horrible! Never flying through this airline again!  I flew from Charlotte to Nashville. On my way back from Nashville, my flight was delayed which turned into cancelation with no explanation as to why. I\\'m diabetic and had no more medication because I thought I would be back in Charlotte to take it that day. There was one couple in front of me trying to get home for work the next day like a lot of other people on the plane including myself. They were able to get a standby flight but I was told I couldn\\'t even though it was dangerous to me not to have my medication. I thought it was unfair. I missed work and was sick. My situation could have resulted in hospitalization or worse without my medication. I later sent an email for a refund or compensation for what I went through that day and night and they offered me $50. I emailed back saying that was not acceptable. I spent $250 on the ticket and thought they can do better then that. An agent then reached out and called saying since my flight was canceled I could have asked for the refund at the airport and got on another flight with another airline but there\\'s nothing they can do now. If they would have offered me that option when this was happening I definitely would have took it. This was my first time in a long time flying with American and had a horrible experience. There were a few passengers that complained about their experiences with American in the past. Do not fly with this airline. There are better airlines out there. They may be a bit more expensive but worth it not to have this happen to you and probably would compensate or refund to make up for what people go through and to keep a customer happy.   The self serve kiosks seem like a good idea, but people are not good at it and it caused me to miss my flight by 10 mins because my bag needed checked in 45 prior to boarding. Even with 35 minutes left until boarding, I was only given the option of flying the next day, and I had to pay $200 or be on standby, which was not guaranteed. Additionally, the rep was mad even before I got to her. I realize it\\'s a difficult job, but if you are only going to be frustrated and short with people, maybe you should look into another line of work. Overall, American is pretty terrible, but this experience left me very frustrated. I could not get further up in the line even though I was missing my window to check my bag. The one person they had helping people get to kiosks could\\'ve been bringing people who were flying immediately to the front, or they could\\'ve offered to check my bag at the gate. Poor attitude and no real offers to resolve anything. Lastly, I was charged $30 again for bag fees. Everyone should know that you cannot talk to anyone about these customer service issues, you just submit online and they send back an email stating how sorry they are and even though they can\\'t help you, they will forward your concerns to leadership so they can hear it. I\\'ll be flying a different carrier from here on out.  Due to COVID-19 they said the meal service was limited. When they say limited they mean you pay the same price as per COVID and get a broken seat, no food, some crackers and an 4OZ bottle of water. The floor was dirty, the plane smelt, no blanket, no anything. You could book First for the price but they let people on regardless of what was called. Seat wouldn’t recline and had crackers and crumbs all on it. The crew were nice. The plexiglass cover to the window fell off during takeoff. It really was a flying piece of junk. I will never fly American Airlines again. At least Delta offers food. I hope they go out of business. They’ve earned it. The inflight entertainment was your phone but WiFi was broken. They had dogs on the flight that kept barking. Photo included below. The barking caused babies on the pane to cry.   I have encountered an awful incident & demeaning interaction with an AA staff assigned to do the boarding process. Before they started calling the group number assigned to board the plane. Before boarding time, we were already standing behind the wall that was out of the way from the line to wait for our group number to be called. While I was standing with my sister, we witnessed the agent display unprofessional behaviors towards other passengers specifically to the girl/teen in his age group. He was suspicious but flirting at the same time, & asking her if she was the one in the passport, but then let her go and let her board the plane anyways without calling the security check. Another incident, he let the a person board, even though it was not his turn to board yet, his number was the same as ours, and AA staff said, \"Are you alone? but, I will let you go, even if it\\'s not your turn to board yet, just this time.” After a few more mins, the agent had stopped calling the group number & instead, he had started just saying, next, to let the other passengers board without calling the sequence number. So, I finally approached him, what number he was calling, he then screamed at me and told us to go to the “cue” which we did & followed him, but first, I had told him to “cool it down” & no need to scream at us, it’s unnecessary. We then proceeded to the wall behind us and went to the passenger line, where he said the ”cue” as exactly what he just told us to do. I saw him smirking, laughing with another passenger, and telling her about us. At the same time, I had overheard the agent calling the security to do a luggage check on us for no apparent reason.  I totally understood clearly that a random check could happen at any time to anyone to check luggage again if they are under any suspicion. But the agent acted more like a scornful staff & retaliated further to show his power.  We didn’t leave the airport, we were just there for transfers & we are just there for boarding. Even the supervisor told me he was not supposed to do that without letting him know first. He clearly violated AA protocol per his supervisor.    I have flown on 6 AA flights since April 27th. Every single one was late by at least an hour. I am sitting in Charlotte now waiting to get on a flight to Raleigh. It is 1:45 late assuming it takes off. It is a miserable airline. It has been a miserable airline for years.   American Airlines is the worst. They gave several excuses of why the flight cancelled and the fact of the matter is myself and 500 other passengers clearly saw it was a system outage on Dallas Ft Worth website. The ticket staff are rude, the flight attendants are rude and the customer service agents are nasty as well. They\\'ll try to redirect you to their website instead of assisting you.  Save yourself the hassle and fly with another airline.   This is by far the worst flying experience I’ve ever had the displeasure of experiencing. The staff were unhelpful, rude, and just gave wrong directions, our gate changed a total of five times and looping back to our original gate, it took two hours to even get a crew on board the plane, and when we were finally seated and ready to go, they had to refuel the plane! Our flight was supposed to leave at 4 pm, but it left at 9:20pm. I never wish to fly with this horrible airline for as long as I live. Awful experience.   On a flight today there was no social distancing. All seats were taken including middle seats. Customers were talking without wearing their masks or had their noses sticking out. Staff did not say anything. I guess social distancing does not apply. Maybe big companies like American Airlines do a secret payout and don\\'t have to follow the social distancing rules. American Airlines seems to care only about their money. The couldn\\'t seem to care less if anyone gets coronavirus.   Worst airline. All connections missed because of their incompetence. I will never fly AA again. I would rather not travel than be on this airline. Ruined going and coming back on my vacation. Truly unreal how bad they are. Pay more if you must.   Thank you American Airlines for destroying an entire day of my vacation. A simple 40 minute flight ending up taking 5 hours to even board because their planes are getting too hot. Too bad, that is none of our problems and we’re the ones who pay for it in the end. In an era where people can barely afford taking vacations, they exacerbate the problem by ruining the days of several planefuls of people. Worst flight I’ve ever taken. But it’s okay, they gave us $24 in meal vouchers, which translates to 2 candy bars and 2 sodas at the airport.  The worst airline with the worst customer service ever! AA cancelled the 1st leg of my trip then charged me to rebook because I had no choice but to drive 5 hours to catch my connecting flight. I was charged a change fee and the ticket prices at a higher cost and 30 days later no refund for cancelled ticket or extra charges. In addition the reps are rude and have even gone so far as to hang up. You can’t get a response from customer service email so I gave files claim with credit card!   This isn\\'t about one flight, this is about multiple times that we flew AA, said give them one more chance. This is about 5 and 6 hour flight delays with excuses as long as your arm. Running out of fuel, its hot (yes, that was an actual excuse), we need to get back in line, on and on. Their record with us is about 50 percent on time, the rest some version of mega late. Worst of all, it costs us every time they screw up; a missed motel, an added motel, extra days at the kennel, tours missed, rental cars and rooms that are sub par left over because American Airlines cant be bothered with details such as on time. When a service costs me more than its cost to fix the damage, its time to toss it. Im just not going to fly with them as late is their goal.   I have a broke back and I\\'m 65 years old. This is the 3rd. time I have flown and each time was horrible! No wheelchairs even though requested, no customer service to help, it\\'s ridiculous. Even if it\\'s not first class it\\'s expensive and they need to do better. If my grandchildren weren\\'t in California. I would never fly again! But I will find a different route next time so not to use Charlotte airport   This airline is allergic to being on time. The schedules only exist to frustrate you and be delayed, and if a flight is actually less than 30 minutes delayed (or heaven forbid on time) that is the outlier, not the norm. You will miss a flight and they won\\'t care. Their pilots are desperate to compete for title of Worst Landing.  I have never had a stewardess apologize for how bad the pilot\\'s landing was, and that has now happened twice in 48 hours. Ridiculous. Plus the seats being hard as rocks doesn\\'t help. The DFW American Airline flights are their own personal lows.   Business now is more expensive than ever, except you’re getting less than ever. Even when requesting a cold beverage during a lengthy boarding process - the answer was not now! Not when we are in the air, which cold be in 45 min. The food is no longer a treat if you can eat what is being offered now. Should I consider moving to a better airline? Executive Platinum Passenger   Flight from OAJ was delayed by an hour due to bad weather (which is understandable) departed at 7pm, didn\\'t get to CLT until 8:10 pm, CLT is huge and it takes like 15 minutes to get to my gate, causing me to miss my connecting flight to BWI at 8:28 pm. But I managed to arrive 2 minutes left at B9. However, I was notified that my gate changed to B12. It\\'s 8:29, so I run over and now the door to my connecting flight is closed. Too late to board. Gate agent couldn\\'t help me, so I was directed to AA Customer Service, which took 2 hours to wait in line. Waited in line, and on the phone for an hour. I couldn\\'t get a flight change on the phone, luckily I was near the end and got told that my flight was actually delayed? But it literally left when I arrived. Then was told that I was checked in, meaning someone was checked in with my seat before I arrived late. That I paid for. Odd. Finally I got another flight which was delayed by an hour. It took 5 hours to get me home. This was my first AA mishap, and it was trying to say the least.  Horrible experience. Not even boarded on our flight yet and I am already so disgusted by this airline that I need to write this review. Overall terrible experience. Check-in is a huge pain, American Airlines website is terrible, slow and difficult to use. Use of the Verifly app for Covid-19 information is another terrible experience for which no guidance is provided. This is a 16hr intercontinental flight, and you can\\'t sit next to your flying partner. They purposely place you in different rows and then force you to pay $120+ per person, per flight to change your seats. I have never seen this greed before, not even Ryanair. Worst experience and worst airline I have ever flown ever.   I really to thank you Deborah Martin from American Airlines LA for a great assistance she gave to a friend and I. We got out flight changed at the last minute while we was waiting to do the check in. It was changed for the next day and she fixed it putting us in the next flight getting to the destination at the same time. We really appreciate. Thank you again!  There is a policy at American Airlines that if they can get you to your destination within 24 hours of the time you were supposed to arrive then they will not allow you to switch airlines. We were supposed to leave Oklahoma at 6.20am and arrive in Florida at 10.30am but due to total chaos and hours at the airport, being directed to incorrect lines wasting precious time we missed the flight. Not that big of a deal because we could still catch a flight at 2pm the same day and make it to Florida by 6pm with Delta but because this policy is in place the agent had to put us on a flight at 5am the next day with American Airlines that would get us there 40 minutes shy of the 24 hour rule. We missed an entire day and a paid non refundable hotel night in Florida because this policy would not allow us to switch to Delta and leave the day we were supposed to. I can’t believe that. 40 minutes and I miss a whole day. Never again will we use this airline.   We had a flight from Houston to Charlotte to attend a family reunion. We checked into the flight the evening before. We arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to our flight and as we walked to the desk to check in our luggage we receive an email saying flight is canceled. The man at the desk didn\\'t care that our flight was canceled and didn\\'t help us find a solution. I went over to Delta and they spent 45 minutes trying to help us find 2 seats on a plane with any carrier. American employees spent 0 time , they just didn\\'t care. To receive a refund I have to do everything and American does nothing. No customer service at all. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I missed a reunion with my family that had been planned a whole year in advance. The fact that the agents didn\\'t care, didn\\'t help with a solution and didn\\'t help complete a refund tells me American Airlines is not a customer orientated oriented.   I had my flight from Dallas to New york on 18th May. After 2 hours of layover I had my connecting flight from NY to Doha. We boarded the flight and after 30 mins it was announced flight is broken so it’s canceled. We all waited for almost an hour to get an update if we are getting another flight. We were told to go to a different gate. Now after 2 hours they started checking our passport because the new flight we got was smaller than previous and they couldn’t accommodate everyone. Few of the passengers didn’t get the seat. At 1:00am they told us flight is rescheduled to afternoon 1:00pm and we will provide you accommodation and only $12 for food. We all didn’t have dinner because of all the delaying and they just gave $12. It took them a whole lot of time to provide hotel details to everyone and I reached my hotel at 3am and hungry. Next day we got transportation provided but it came so late that we reached the airport just 2 hours before the boarding time. Now after reaching the airport passengers for doha were in a separate queue where only 2 counters were open and all others were in a queue with 8-9 counters open. Now with 1 hour remaining to check in they said we cannot check in because you are late and it’s just 1 hour for the flight. After arguing with the manager somehow they let us check in and go to the flight. But again we are here sitting inside for 2 hours and delaying further more. Worst customer service experience ever. Flight get delayed/canceled but this is not how you provide customer service. All the staff were rude and unaccomodating.  As all are experiencing flights are changing. My flights I was offered from the airline left me stranded in North Carolina as my flight to Jamaica would have left before I arrived! After dealing with customer service for two hours now having to stay overnight somewhere costing me more money with no offers. Flying first class and find out they are sending me somewhere that the lounge is closed when there were options to go other places. Clearly they are trying to push people through with no consideration of what they are doing or the money you spent on getting somewhere. Never will fly this airline again. I fly all the time and clearly a reason why I don\\'t fly them.   This airline strives for your loyalty. The propaganda they present about all the perks and rewards are superficial. Please do not be drawn into their words and advertisements. The fact that they strive for your loyalty but show zero loyalty back to you when needed is prevalent at the most in opportune time. I was a big advocate for this airlines being that I fly between 3-5 times a month. The perks for being a loyalty member were ok at best. The more you ride the train the more you see that loyalty is just a number. When you ask of them in a time of need, they will not be there. All you are is a number when it comes to their customer service. I booked a flight 5 months in advance. Their policy is within 24 hrs of booking you can cancel for a refund. I cancelled within 48 hrs and all they would be willing to do is give me a flight credit of the amount spent ($2500). They do not budge and the lack of loyalty in return is magnified. Spare yourself the stress and find a more customer orientated airlines to be loyal too. Let me add that you cannot talk to someone physically over the phone in their customer relations department. You’re Left with submitting a form and waiting for their response which is 7 business days.   There is literally no way to talk to an AA employee who can do something about a poor experience. A customer must instead complete a cumbersome on-line form. I submitted such a form and included the information below. At a bare minimum, I am entitled to a refund of the difference between first class and coach, and I should also receive compensation. Instead, all I got was a short form email response that said “sorry” and a $25 credit. Unbelievable. My trip was a disaster for many reasons, including how I was treated by American after the trip. It is clear that American upper management cares only about short term profits and is not focused on the long term or its customers. This is a shortsighted approach and American will pay the price in the end. Is management oblivious to the terrible reputation American has in the marketplace? Many people — including me at this point — simply refuse to fly the airline. And American employees are equally frustrated with the company. Almost without exception, when I related my poor experience, they apologized and said they wish there was something they could do but the company will not allow them to take any action. And almost without exception, they went on voice their serious concerns about how the company is managed. Upper management, wake up! You are headed for disaster unless you alter course. Here is the information I submitted on the form: “Issues with first leg: I received multiple text messages which postponed my original flight multiple times. Weather was a factor but most of the delay was due to mechanical problems, poor planning, and mismanagement. My original flight from SLC to DFW was scheduled to leave at 2:02pm. It was first postponed to 3:01pm. It was then postponed to 4:18pm, then 5:18pm, then 6:32pm, then 7:28pm, then 8:12pm, etc. etc. etc. The flight was finally scheduled to depart at 10:25pm, a full 8.5 hours later than the original departure time. Meanwhile, inexplicably, many other flights left on time or with only short delays. I stood in a quite long line at the SLC airport, I had to be quite aggressive to get a seat on a flight to Dallas that departed at approximately 5:30pm, and I lost my first class seat. As an aside, a long line should have been unnecessary, but there were only AA agents at one of the AA gates and there were only two agents. Why not more agents at more gates since AA was of course fully aware of the many issues arising? Issues with second leg: Here is my updated boarding pass for my second leg, Flight 1007: When we landed at DFW, I walked to Gate C6 but when I went to board with my updated boarding pass they told me that I was not on the flight and that I had been rebooked on another earlier flight that had already departed a short time before! Why didn’t anybody tell me? I could have made that flight if I had only known. Again, being somewhat aggressive, I was able to get a ticket on Flight 1007 which they had told me was full. However, again, I lost my first class seat. Issues with luggage: When I finally arrived in New Orleans, it took at least 45 minutes for baggage to start being loaded onto the carousel. And after waiting for all the luggage to come through, which also took significant time, I realized that both my bags had been lost. I then needed to go to the AA baggage claim office, wait in a long line there, & answer many questions. They eventually told me that my bags never left SLC. Etc.  Las Vegas to Chicago. We boarded the plane which was a late flight departing at midnight. We get a notification on our phone that the flight is cancelled. We hear after that from the attendants that our pilot never showed up. The only available flight I could book got me to my destination 8 hours later than expected and all the attendants said was sorry, and call this number to help you. The fact that there was no compensation or voucher for the fact I had to sit in an airport for 6 hours is disgusting. American Airlines treats its customers like a product rather than an efficient way to travel.   AA plane was late, gate changed very far away. Confusion with pre-requisites and boarding. On tarmac 1-2 hours, told seat belt mechanism not functioning so to wait for part. Then told by pilot we all had to deplane due to FAA regulations (3 hrs.late) and new crew to be called. No good, no compensation. 6 hrs late. Never AA again. Had trouble prior with American Airlines and Dallas airport.  By far the worst airline I have ever flown with. Highly recommend not to fly with American Airlines. I typically never write reviews but this has been an absolute disaster after having the flight delayed 5 times in one night to then cancelling our flight. After 6 long hrs of being at the airport waiting for the plane to arrive the staff that works for American Airlines was extremely rude and unhelpful for us passengers as they threatened to call the police on those who were upset with the many inconveniences with this airline. Will never fly through them again!   Paid for reservation of 4 seats. (Made reservation, same seats for return flight, for personal reason child). On boarding passes we got these. But on the plane we were told to take place on other seats. Even before we saw that our seats were occupied. Purser adviced us to ask for refund. Result: rejected. Maybe because our boarding pass was correct. And because of the 200 characters, you cannot explain correct. Conclusion: mislead. Never use American Airlines again. Because they did not solve the problem. Mailed to customer service with attachments. But they cannot overrule decisions. Offered a trip credit for next flight. But that is not how it should be.  I would never recommend nor fly with America Airlines again. I booked a flight several months prior with an initial connection at ORD of 2 hours and 10 minutes of which I paid $600 (for one way). A few weeks before my flight I received an email that my connection flight was changed to only 50 minutes, then furthermore it changed to only a 38 minute connection. I contacted customer service that day of which they told me I would be fine with that connection, that AA does not book flights that passengers cannot make connections. To be on the safe side, I paid an additional $25 to get a seat near the front of the plane for my first flight so that I could plan to quickly get to my second plane. Unfortunately, there were no other options to get to my destination on that date so I was very limited in my options but felt assured by the $625+ spent on one flight that American Airlines would get me to my destination on the day planned. The day of my travel arrives, flight was running on time, boarded on time. Then once boarding was complete the pilot announces that there is weather east of ORD and we would need to add significant amount of time to our flight along with needing more fuel (this was the first flight of the day for this plane, why would fuel not already have been filled?!). So after an additional 40 minutes of fueling we finally took off. We arrived in ORD over an hour late and then had to sit and wait for a gate. I expressed my concerns about my connection to multiple airline attendants who said “maybe they would hold the plane since it’s the only one going to MSO today.” Once finally off the plane, I ran across ORD airport in hopes that maybe my flight was waiting, unfortunately it was not and the attendant couldn’t have been more rude, telling me to just go see customer service. 50 minutes in the customer service line (with many disgruntled AA passengers) I researched what else I could do to still make it to Montana since no one at American was willing or able to assist. Fortunately, I found a flight to an airport of which was 2.5 hours from my destination so I asked if I could have a seat on that flight as someone must have missed that connection. I waited another hour until that delayed plane departed but fortunately was able to ride that one. I then had to proceed to pay $175 for a rental car to drive the 2.5 hours to my initial airport on top of arriving half a day late. I sent my complaint to American Airlines asking to be refunded the $175 I paid for a rental of which I was fully dismissed by a generic response from customer relations department. I will never recommend anyone to fly American Airlines due to total lack of planning, preparation and horrible customer service.   Very rude security staff in Palm Springs. I actually got yelled at for not being fast enough getting stuff out of my bag. When landing at our connecting airport, they changed the gate — putting us about as far as we could be from our connecting gate. We had to run to make it — couldn’t pee couldn’t eat. American should’ve offered us transport at the very least. We are not young and this was extremely difficult. We’ve flown American exclusively for more than a decade, but this was it for me. I’m not going to give thousands of dollars to a company that can’t be bothered to care.   Not only was flight my flight cancelled 3 hours before take off, but since American decided to cancel all of their flights that weekend, they could not get me on a rescheduled flight. I had to book a ticket through another airline the day of my flight which costed me double the amount of money. American took 4 hours to return the call and then did nothing to help me. I decided to still fly with American for my returning flight to prevent buying another ticket on such a short notice. Once I get to the gate, they delayed the flight which is now causing me to miss my connecting flight. I am active duty military and only have a certain amount of time to fly home and fly back and the customer service was absolutely no help and I am now out of much more money than I originally planned for. I will never fly with American again.   So, preparing for my flight, I recently bought a brand new suitcase set. They were quite nice and were not cheap by no means. The smaller bag has a numerical lock on the front. I guess at some point after I had checked my bags they felt the need to search this particular one. Well, though I am fairly certain the code was set so all they had to do was push a button to open it, this is not what happened. Instead of checking the lock, or even finding away to speak with the owner of the bag to get the code, they busted it open. Definitely weren\\'t careful about it at all. By the time the bag made it back to me, the lock had been rigged to look like it could stay closed, though my bag was actually being held closed by tape. Once I was able to open my bag I found a little piece of paper stuck in there with a paragraph highlighted claiming that they are not liable for the damage cause to any of my items while searching my bag. I don\\'t understand why no other actions, besides damaging my property, were taken. My bag is completely unable to be used and I still have to fly home. Now I will have to pay to have it fixed or replaced simply because they couldn\\'t be bothered to ask a simple question.   American Airlines advertises no change fees but that\\'s simply not true. I cancelled my reservation, they said the value of my ticket 58.10 would be on hold for future use. I went to rebook another reservation for the same amount and I was told there would be a $50.00 service charge because I made this reservation through a third party. Why is there a $50.00 service charge but the credit is held for the reservation that is on file with you. I used another credit with no issue. So American Airlines policy of no change fee is not true, you\\'re not calling it a \"change fee\" its now a \"service charge\".   The worst airline I’ve traveled in my life! They delayed and cancelled our flight day after day for 2 days, minutes before departure, let delaying then cancelling again, and gave excuses for weather and nature related issues, did not care to take any responsibility for the passengers after a long flight and kept us stranded for 2 days in Dallas , with us having to spend for overnight stay and driving back to Houston on our own expense. Absolutely rude , unprofessional and incompetent in flying, handling customers and considering families with kids! They even retained our baggage and told us it will fly in the next flight, which still haven’t! A bunch of liars, unprofessional staff with no integrity for customer relations and helping passengers. Airport was a chaos and flight management was a joke with the airline. Never flying with them again! I’d rather pay extra for a reliable airline!   This is the single worst flying experience I have ever experienced!! This was my first time flying American Airlines and I will never be flying with them again! They lost $2,000 worth of my family’s luggage and then didn’t offer little to any help explaining what caused the problem or how we could rectify the problem. I will continuously advise family and friends to avoid American Airlines   Who would have thought that getting to the airport 2.5 hours before a departure would not be enough time to get through the check in line causing us to miss our flight and stay overnight. I will never fly this airline again. I’m still waiting in line and I’ve been on hold for the same amount of time.   On January 23rd 2022 I booked a 4-night honeymoon vacation to Key West, which 2 roundtrip flights with American Airlines were part of. The first thing that happens to start the list of many problems is the first flight was cancelled due to weather. The AA agent at the airport told us they knew about this 4-5 hours ahead of time and no notification was sent to us, we checked all morning and the flight showed \"on time\". After waiting for two chances at standby for 5+ hours our only option was to book a flight the following morning that AA said they would book through United Airlines for us. No proof or tickets were ever given to us or offered at this point. We show up the following day for the make-up flight, and United Airlines tells us that American Airlines never booked the tickets properly and because of that, we had no flight. We go back to talk to AA supervisor, and she gives nothing but excuses (with no care about the situation) and tell me there is no way to print me proof that the tickets were ever booked. This mistake cost us two days worth of luxury hotel reservations. I believe the agent never truly booked us tickets, and used United as a scapegoat to cost us more money. They also shipped our checked bag to Key West on the initial flight to arrive to Key West 2 days earlier than we even could. I attempted to reach someone to discuss this through their phone system, and was met with 20+ minutes of holding to be told that internally American Airlines does not have a way for customers to speak with someone about the compensation they owe certain customers. Every step of the way American Airlines makes things as terrible and impossible as they can for their customers. Avoid this company at all costs. There is no worse option for travel in the industry than American Airlines.  First off, I was the one who made the initial mistake of picking the day before my son\\'s big event. I admitted that. I needed the flight to be the next day or so. But this was my first time purchasing or flying with American and I went through the checkout process I guess I picked something called \"Basic\" which they explained \"basically\" means you are out of luck if you need any kind of assistance, customer service, and definitely any changes. After speaking with a chat agent that is what we finally established. They CAN make changes, they are just UNWILLING if you make a mistake like I did (and even willing to pay a fee btw). You know... The customer! The chat is below. The agent, their employee, agreed their policy is ridiculous. Now, some of you may say, \"Well, that\\'s just their policy so sorry about your luck\"! And I would say, \"You are absolutely correct, \\'By-the-book-Bobby\\'\"! But I\\'m sorry, if that is a company\\'s stance on helping a customer I will just find a new company moving forward and share my experience, hopefully warn potential victims of theirs moving forward, and share my dissatisfaction! My disgust! We are not valued as customers to these airlines. We\\'ve all known that for a very long time. American Airlines, I will never fly with you again, just out of principal.   Worst experience ever! Delay caused re-scheduling for myself and my son. Nothing available until evening of next day. Had to pay $387 for a hotel room as it was a holiday weekend and all rooms were sold out or required a 2 day minimum stay. Had to pay another $166 for rental car car, dog sitter and cancel plans for the next 2 days as a result. Received a text with new reservations 17 hours prior to departure stating a connecting flight would be delayed. I\\'m cancelling my end of July trip until they get their act together. My best friend had her Friday flight cancelled, re-scheduled flight 2 days later delayed, which made for a 12 hour day of flying. They should not schedule if they are not staffed! Paying customers are the ones that suffer!   Terrible Experience. American flew myself and my 10lb puppy from Chicago to Denver no problem. This was my first time flying with a pet in cabin. I then returned to check-in to come home and the check-in agent was very rude from the beginning basically saying \"what do you want\" as soon as I approached the counter. She denied myself the flight because of my puppy. Who is very well behaved. He was too small and in a soft crate in which there is no way I would put him in with luggage. I requested an exemption because American had no issue flying me out. She said no. Really put me in a stuck situation. From the rudeness and fact that I had to cancel my flight and then was happily greeted by Frontier Airlines who got me home, I will never fly American again.  Flight got delayed and delayed for hours without warning. Plane was old and dirty. They didn’t offer anything to the all the people that got stuck due to the delays.   The actual flight wasn\\'t horrible but I bought 5 tickets all together and none of us sat together. Wifi was horrible. I paid 30 dollars to check my bag and they lost it. When I reported it they didn\\'t seem too concerned and I was told when we find it we will call you. Sure didn\\'t get a refund on my 30 dollars either. Will never fly this airline again.   I am exec platinum and a lifetime platinum member of AA having flown nearly 4,000,000 miles. I am so disappointed with American and their food service. I’m also disappointed that they haven’t bothered to open up all their flagship lounges. The food is the worst I’ve ever tasted. I’ve started bringing my own food on board now, even when I’m traveling international first class, because it’s that bad. American, come on! Please provide hot meals that aren’t lousy tasting. No more cold sandwiches and please open the flagship lounges. You are slighting your best customers and if it continues I’ll be looking for another airline. We deserve better than what we’re getting these days.   I don\\'t write reviews often unless something dramatic happens, so I want to let people know about unprofessional and dangerous events that happen to me so management can fix or do something to eliminate such behaviors. I was recently a passenger on an American flight from St. Paul, MN, to Midland, TX. I was boarding the plane with my carry one bag and my laptop\\'s bag. The country agent was rude, asking me to check in the carry one claiming it was bigger than American allows as carryingone. Just for a note, I traveled with this specific carry-on all time and no problem at all. In fact, I traveled with this exact one \"carry-on\" on American airline before, and there was no problem at all. So I didn\\'t say anything, and they took my carry one and charged me $30. I boarded the flight, no social distances for sure, then noticed that someone vomited on the chair in front of mine. With Covid, seeing that was break dealer to me. I would never fly with an American airline, and people should be careful using this airline.   American Airlines has finally dropped to the one star category in my opinion, it is actually quite unbelievable how the quality of every aspect of American Airlines has dropped. All the staff from cabin crew to flight crew look disheveled and fed up, uniforms have gone out the window, the cabin crew wear whatever they want and generally they are disinterested. The food, covered many times on this forum goes from bad to worse and in most cases is in fact inedible, I am quite sure that it has been many years since anyone in AA actually tasted or reviewed the food. The seat on the flight in the Flagship Business was not functioning and remained in the upright position for the entire flight, the only available seat was 1A which I was told was reserved by the FAA and in fact turned out 5 hours into the flight was for the captain to have a nap for 2 hours before returning to the cockpit. This really sums up everything about AA, the crew are more important than the paying passengers and the passengers are merely a distraction while the staff wait for their pensions or redundancies. As far as I know, no other \\'reputable\\' airline puts its staff in premium seats, they use cabin rest areas, this seat should have been given up to accommodate the paying passenger, who also happens to be an Advantage Platinum member, what does it say about an airline that makes a paying passenger sit upright for 8 hours and lets the captain use a seat for a 2 hours when there is a crew rest area on the 777-200 aircraft? I have flown AA many times and no matter what happens or what situation occurs I will never fly with AA again. On the take off from Miami all the window blinds remained down and nobody appeared to be bothered, with the 25 year old planes, the lack of maintenance and despite the disinterested crew and the terrible service AA will always have passengers that have to fly, but those with a choice with certainly not choose American Airlines. I wonder how long it will be before AA is actually a 1 Star airline on Skytrax, it has fallen steadily over the last few years and it would seem that Management are completely oblivious to the disgraceful state of the airline.   I am at the airport terminal as we speak. First of all, I had to pay $30 for a checked bag? Nowhere was this told to me when I bought the ticket/went online to make sure as long as it was up to 70 lbs the bag was complimentary. When did it change? I received no email in regard to this payment!  Secondly, I was astonished at the many ignorant employees throughout this terminal. The customer service was very good. Kind gentleman (after paying $30). After that, down hill. I am 62 years old with medical issues. This is my first trip out of the country in 21 years. I travel alone. The man barking at me at security huffing, puffing ,eye-rolling I assume because I asked him questions about the procedure. Very ignorant. After being patted down all over, I asked 3 uniformed individuals about where I was supposed to go. #1 completed ignored me after calling out twice. She was right in front of me! #2 \"Follow the signs.\" Walked away. #3 Looked at me in absolute disgust. Said \"go to C.\" I called out after him no response. Truthfully, I was attempting to decipher the boarding pass where it tells you the letters and numbers. I sat for a while after following terminal C signs that ended abruptly with D. Finally, after calling out to 2 janitors they gave me great help and answered all of my evidently stupid questions.   I did not even have the opportunity to take this flight, but I wanted to share my experience with their customer service department. I called to cancel my flight and receive a refund due to the time being changed on my flight. When I called, the person taking my call informed me that they could not refund my money because the tickets had been purchased through a travel company and that the airline did not receive payment for the tickets. This was clearly incorrect because I had an airline confirmation number, confirmed seats and flight numbers. Further, my deposit for the trip was the price of my airline tickets and my \\'Cancel for any Reason\\' fee. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, the American Airlines representative was angry and told me that I needed to call the travel company. I told the person that I already did and they informed me that I needed to contact the airline. When I asked to go through the refund process with the airline, the AA representative told me that it would be denied. I became firm and told the AA representative that I wanted to go through the process anyway, and he hung up on me. I will never fly with American Airlines again. Their lack of customer service and humanity to their customers is ridiculous.   We paid for a first class ticket and had chosen our seats when booking since we were traveling with a baby. They changed our seats the day before our flight without us knowing so that we were separated and then when our flight was delayed, we got bumped to coach with no refund.  This is the worst airline ever. With my flight experience I would say I would take my chances and ride Spirit after my time with AA. My flight was delayed by hours and the inside of the plane is burning hot. The people boarding me weren\\'t paying attention and that\\'s probably why I got delayed 4 hours. Never again will I ride AA after my experience.   The worst experience flying ever. Got in from Austin with 2.5 hours to spare. Told Gate was B10. Confirmed on board. Sat there for over an hour only to find out gate was changed to B8. Never heard 1 announcement until gate was closing. Had to go to customer service who put me on a flight that left in 5 hours. Asked what gate. I was told (as was another woman who missed the same flight) A2. After sitting there for awhile was told our gate was B6. Sitting here now. Hopefully I get him sometime this week.   Flight 2414 was scheduled to leave Dulles at 5:09 pm. We all boarded the plane and were ready to depart when the grounds crew reported a stick in the wing. We waited 10 - 15 minutes and then we were told we had to deplane because there was a bird\\'s nest in the wing that would take 1 - 2 hours to clean out. One hour later groups 1 - 3 boarded the plane again and then we were all told that Dallas  Fort Worth had grounded all flights because of weather. I flight then let 3.5 hours late at about 8:36 pm. Upon arriving in Dallas my connecting flight had already left the airport and there were no other flights. This resulted in my wife and I having to pay for a Lyft because all the shuttles had ended at 10:30 pm. Then we had to pay for a hotel because American insisted that our flight was delayed because of the weather. I reported all of this to American Airlines customer service but they continued to insist the delay was because of weather and even if there was a bird\\'s nest that would also be something out of the airlines control. Sorry but this is garbage. I have been a loyal American Airlines customer for years but they have devolved into an airline that does not care about their passengers. I will be using my air miles up and never fly American Airlines.   My special needs unattended minor traveled with American Airlines. She had an armband and paperwork on and per corporate and the manager of Jacksonville airport she would be in good hands. Well she was left abandoned at a gate in Chicago O’Hare airport and missed her flight. She was abandoned there for 15 hours and it took hours to make them put her in an unattended minor room and do what they were supposed to do. They tried sending her to a hotel on her own. Well she cannot read or write and is speech impaired, she was left to come up missing or possibly die. Parents don’t trust your kids with American Airlines.   The airline canceled and changed flights without even sending a notification. Customer service was extremely rude both over the phone and at the airport. Seats that were purchased and assigned for changed without my consent and I ended up with the worst seats on the plane. Horrible service all around.   Consistently Horrendous across service matrices. We were supposed to fly American Airlines from Columbus to Philadelphia to Rome. Mechanical delay in Columbus made it apparent we would not make the connection in Philadelphia to Rome. As we attempted to work with the gate agent to make alternative connections, the inept, unhelpful and thoroughly unpleasant gate supervisor interrupted and yelled at the gate agent to: \"let them take care of it in Philadelphia.\" Of course, once we landed in Philly, the gate agent there said: \"They should have taken care of this in Columbus, now we have limited options.\" We were OK with it when she eventually found us a connection through Dublin Ireland to Rome the next afternoon. We made it on the Aer Lingus flight to Dublin. The next afternoon, when attempting to board the flight to Rome, we were denied boarding because the gate agent issued our boarding passes without a ticket number which made them invalid according to Aer Lingus. Hours spent talking to American and were finally able to wrestle them in to getting us on a flight to Naples- (only because I happened to remember the gate agent\\'s name in Philly and threw her under the bus) 36 hours later, we finally got to Italy-and of course, our luggage never made it. We bought all new clothing, toiletries and luggage in Italy. We reported our luggage missing to AA on 7/8. The two staff I was able to communicate with both informed me that: \"Your bags are in Philly\" That\\'s it, no details on when or how they will be returned. It is now 7/26, we have been home for a week, bags have been missing 20 days and attempting to contact anyone at AA is fruitless. Hands down, the worst business ever!   Exceptional staff, very professional and pleasant smiling personalities. Especially with these extra paperwork travel arrangements it is wonderful to have so much calm and composed staff onboard and at the check-in too. Keep up the good work   I am highly dissatisfied with the staff. I paid for business class upon my arrival no wheel chair assistance outside for one, staff was rude, no access to the business lounge if you do not have the American Airlines credit card. No where on the website is this informed. I called American while waiting at the gate where the TSA agent left me with no wheel chair and the young lady prompted me to a long list of promps to get a customer relation assistance. What makes this experience worst American is suppose to be top is the line and I personally will never travel again through them.   Made it through 5 American Airline flights with my luggage no problem, the last flight which happened to be my flight home, and they now decided that my luggage was too big and had to be checked onto the plane. Absolutely furious because the fact that I just wanted to get home after a terrible trip and they just now decide my luggage was “too big” even though it was the same size as when I left Florida. I explained to the lady that when I took out my neck pillow from my luggage that it’d fit requirements, she still continued to tell me it had to be checked. Mindful that I had very expensive diabetic medicine in my luggage. This airline is just absolutely unprofessional and I will not be flying with them again   All my flights got delayed. I waited 3 hours plus one 4 hours. Horrible service when asking questions. No one cares. I would not recommend this airline. I even have flights now back I am very upset to even think about plus on top of that my luggage was damaged and lady said its not covered.   My flight was originally scheduled from Salt Lake to DFW to CVG on 12/13. However, because the initial flight was delayed for 2 hours and no explanation given. Was given a $12 food voucher for my troubles. Arrives in DFW after 10pm (3hrs later than supposed to) and all the restaurants were close, so useless food voucher. Was told I had a room booked inside the airport, however it was 3 miles away and I had to pay for a $30 cab ride there. Arrived at the hotel around midnight, left at 3am because I was rebooked on a 6am flight, $30 cab fair again. Departed from DFW and arrived in Charlotte at 9:02. Sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes. Missed my connecting flight by 15 mins. Was sent to customer service by a rude gate lady who just pointed and mumbled “customer service” Was rebooked again on a 1pm flight to CVG. I have been traveling for 2 days now, through no fault of my own, simply because AA cannot get their stuff together and have their planes arrive on time, their staff be friendly and cannot hire employees who have common sense. I expect a call from AA.   I hope that I never have to fly on AA ever again. I flew on AA July 27, 2021 from LAX to Birmingham AL. I was due to return home, on August 2, 2021, wheels up at 4pm. My flight was delayed several times before, it was finally cancelled at 3pm. I was told initially, that it was due to technical difficulties. After about 3 hours on the phone with an AA agent, I was booked on a flight leaving from Atlanta 8/3/21 @11am. I had a very important doctor’s appointment on the 3rd, that I had to miss. In addition to my missed appointment, I had to pay for transportation and hotel stay. The cost of everything was around 327.00. I submitted a complaint to AA customer service which took them about 2 weeks to respond. Basically, they lied and stated that, they do not compensate passengers for delayed or cancelled flights, due to weather. Well, the delay was not from weather it was from technical issues with their planes.   American Airlines was absolutely the worst airline I have used and I will never be flying with them ever again. Typically I use Frontier, or Allegiant as they are cheap and efficient but I expected better service from American Airlines and was terribly disappointed. My husband and I were taking our final vacation before the birth of our first child together in September, the dates for our travel were September 9th-September 16th. We arrived at CVG airport hours earlier before our departure knowing we had a layover in Dallas. Five minutes before boarding the plane to Dallas, they told us that they were running late, and that we would not make our connecting flight to Miami. Our options were to spend the night at the airport which was not ideal being six months pregnant, or spend another 100 dollars on a hotel room outside of our plans in Dallas. Not only were we forced to get a hotel, but due to their inability to leave on time, we missed a full day at the hotel we paid for in Miami and did not arrive until late September 10th. So much money was lost during this trip for things beyond our control. Take off took 45 minutes to an hour longer than anticipated. They also harass you about your carry on bag size regardless of what the previous airport deemed acceptable. They ran out of space for everyone’s bags and everything has to be shipped in understow. Do not book with American Airlines unless you have an extremely flexible travel schedule.  American is so awful. They are absolutely incompetent and rude. I had spoke to a representative and was told that I would get a full refund if I were to cancel a flight I was no longer able to go on. After this representative assured me I would get a full refund for my flight I went ahead and cancelled and then was told I was not eligible for a refund. Nikita the supervisor was nothing but rude and completely unhelpful. I asked her a question and she completely ignored me and ended the conversation. In the past flying with American I have had absolutely nothing but problems and inconveniences. I would pay for any airline over this one.   Worst experience ever I will never fly with them again on the way to NY my flight was delayed 4 times. On the way back home they completely changed my straight fight to an overnight flight. Then the gate changed twice and it was delayed 4 times. This was the worst experience ever. I do not recommend them.  Overbooked the flights and then mechanical issues delayed the flight. Instead of cancelling the flight and putting us up in a hotel they just keep delaying and delaying. Two days in a row one of the flights to Columbia was cancelled or delayed due to mechanical issues.   I have had a progressively painful and weakening issue with my hands to the point that I had to move states to live with family as I am unable to drive, cook, clean, or work anymore. On a good day I am allowed to lift 5lbs, but most days it\\'s much less than that. I had to fly from TN to MI for my last post-surgical appointment and no one from the airlines actually offered help or how to get help, each person just told me to go to someone else, all while toting my luggage which was way out of my weight range. When I voiced concerns and (once again) the reason I need assistance, they straight up told me to ask other passengers for help instead of offering any real solutions. I have never felt so stranded and frustrated. I have flown a good amount in my life and I\\'m generally ok with giving up quality for price but I will never fly American Airlines again and I will discourage others from doing so. They made me feel like such a hassle and offered no help. Not everyone is able-bodied, and that doesn\\'t always look like wheelchairs.   I would just like to say Thank you to American Airlines for looking out for my Military son. They were able to quickly make changes for him due to unforeseen circumstances. No charge change for him.   1 hour layover became 9 with multiple maintenance issues on multiple planes, sitting in Dallas heat on an airplane with little to no air and horrible customer service with no information whatsoever. Avoid American if you have a choice.   Flew from MCI to Charlotte, Charlotte to Turks and Caicos, Turks and Caicos to DFW, and then DFW to MCI. 4 flights total and 3/4 flights got delayed. Either the crew was running behind, searching for an aircraft, or changing gates. It was a disaster and I do not recommend this airline nor will I fly with them again.   My flight was on September 10th from Rochester to Philadelphia then to Doha, Kathmandu through Qatar Airways. My flight got cancelled & they rebooked the ticket so I was ok thinking it happens. Next day I was suppose to fly Boston then Diana Kathmandu. I was at the Rochester airport from 3pm till 9.30, still couldn’t fly. My flight from Boston to Doha was at 10.25. After 9, no use of flying because airlines don’t provide the hotel. I tried to rebook through counter person at the airport, but they were very rude and unhelpful. I will not travel American Airlines again. They don’t know how to handle the customer.   Was in boarding group 7 and got told that overhead space was at capacity. They made everyone from group 7 and on check their bags. When I got on the flight there was tons of over head rooms and saw passengers that got on after me bring their carry on suitcases. They refused to give me my bag at the layover. I do not check bags because airlines constantly loose them and offer no help to get them back to you. Will not be flying American ever again.   The worst flying experience I’ve had so far. Currently writing this in the airport at 10pm after traveling since 5am so far. Delays due to weather I understand. My first flight was delayed two hours and even though I got to my connecting flight before the schedule departure time, the plane had already left. They said that we weren’t even scheduled on that flight even though we were. Their system had automatically rescheduled me without my approval because they “thought we wouldn’t make it”. When trying to get a new flight with the AA agent, she was huffing and puffing like she was annoyed with us as we were trying to find the best flight that would work for us. When we got to our second flight, there was a ground delay for another two hours. However, one of the hours was due to miscommunication with the airport staff and even though we had been ready to leave for an hour, we were waiting on staff to direct the plane who had no idea that we were ready. On my final flight to my destination there was another 45 minute delay. When the boarding time came, staff had announced that there will be another delay but they could not give us an estimated departure or arrival time. They did not even give us an explanation as to why, however another passenger later found out it was due to the crew members never arriving and no one was able to contact them. the tickets weren’t cheap and it has ended up being a waste of my money and time.   American Airlines has the worst customer service of all Airlines. I have never seen employees so rude that can\\'t help resolve simple issues. Everytime there was an issue to arise they always say there is nothing they can do about it. I have booked with them twice and both times have been awful experiences.  I understand that there are circumstances especially due to covid that would create flight changes. But having your flight changed 5 times and then given a 9 hour layover is unacceptable. I changed the flight to a different one that not only was an inconvenience, but it took away time from the resort I\\'m staying at. In addition, I am flying first class and one leg of the flight, I\\'m not even sitting with my husband due to the fact the new flights seats are already booked up. When bringing this matter to their attention, this was the response I got: March 22, 2022 Hello Mrs. Nash: Thanks for reaching out to us. I\\'m so sorry to hear how your plans have been affected by this schedule change. As a traveler myself, I know schedule changes can be unexpected and often unwelcome, especially for those of us who carefully plan itineraries. I understand that you would like other flight options, and have questions about your seat assignments. Our Reservations representatives will be happy to assist you. For your convenience, they\\'re available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by calling 800-433-7300. Please have your record locator DIHPAO handy. Our Reservations team may be experiencing a higher than normal call volume, and we encourage you to see if you are eligible to make changes online at aa.com. You may also want to try calling closer to the date of travel. I understand that you\\'re requesting compensation due to the unexpected change in your itinerary. We know that schedule changes are not always convenient for our customers, but they are a necessary part of the normal operation of the airline industry. While I understand your perspective, I must respectfully decline your request. Mrs. Nash, from all of us at American Airlines, we thank you for flying with us and appreciate your loyalty as an AAdvantage® member since 2019. We look forward to caring for you on your next journey.   I will never fly with this airline again. They gave my ticket to a standby passenger instead just because I was one minute late due gate change. Then they rebooked me to another flight and the seat was already assigned to someone else and the kicked me off.   Worst flying experience ever! No aspect of social distancing whatsoever! My flight was packed to the brim with no space in between seats and no limitation on number of people flying. My seat was dirty with crumbs all over it showing how little they clean them in the time of a pandemic. You would think with what’s going on they would actually clean the seats especially when there’s 200 people packed on a flight! The flight was also delayed and they had us board at 11:04 and leave at 12:16. On top of that They had us board an un distanced plane for an extra hour when they were aware that the plane would be leaving later. Not to mention the extremely long layover! ridiculous. Worst flight ever. Never fly American Airlines. Terribly uncomfortable and dirty.   I travel all the time taking my 3 grandsons. I travel either Alaska Airlines or Delta Airlines and never in 30 years have had a problem. We travel 4 to 5 times a year. Seattle was great everything went smooth. I get into key West and they sent my bag to Saint louis, even though we changed planes in Dallas Texas. That was a inconvenient but I wasn\\'t mad yet. The really kicked back laid back staff at the counter said it was arriving 4 hours later (at 7pm) and they would have it delivered. Not at all. I spent hour the next day hunting it down. Loosing a bag happens, not caring is not acceptable.   They just left me at the airport where I transit and waited for more than 2 hours. The airline knew I was there and already checked in. They can call my number but no. they purposely left me at the airport in the middle of the night. Never again fly American Airlines. In the cabin they didn’t put the AC on, with mask and people sitting next to your face, I felt nauseated the whole flight. I rather fly Spirit if there is no other option.   Currently stuck at the Dallas/Ft Worth Airport due to a missed connection flight to Fort Myers (home). We flew AA about 6 years ago and had a horrible experience with flight delays due to mechanical issues and no AC in the aircraft. We decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and fly with them in July 2021. Even worse than before! The unprofessionalism and lack of knowledge by the customer service agents at this airport is unreal. Could not put us on a flight until the following day, no hotel options, and still could not tell us why our plane was late having us to miss our connecting flight. Don\\'t be fooled by their cheaper pricing. Pay the extra dollars and fly Delta. Our time is valuable AA! We trust our airlines to get us from A to B safely and in a timely manner and you failed to do so.   This has been the worst flight I’ve ever had. I decided to spend 4 nights in Cancun for my yearly trip out of the country, and while my trip was fine every flight I had was terrible. I flew from Lexington, KY had a stop in Charlotte, NC before going to Cancun, Mexico. I went back the same way. My first flight was delayed for an hour and 30 minutes causing me to miss my connecting flight. So I ended up having to get another flight which ALSO ended up being delayed for an hour and 30 minutes. After my time at the resort I’d put it behind me, but when I was driven back to CUN around 1pm. My flight was delayed until 10AM the next day. I ended up staying the night in the airport and having to check in again. When I finally made it to Charlotte around 2:30PM, the final flight was also delayed and it was delayed 4 hours. I’m never flying with American Airlines again, and I’m never connecting in Charlotte again. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Fly delta or Allegiant.   They delayed my flight three times after I arrived to the airport and provided false departure time, which caused me to miss my overseas flight. They refused to refund a new ticket I had to buy, after a month and a half, after don’t know how many hours spent on the line with their customer service and writing emails, they suggested to return 200$ as apology for this whole mess they made. For the ticket Paid 600$, for so many hours spent stuck at the airport(s), for almost 12 hours delayed arrival home and all that stress they caused me.   Worst experience of my life. Aircraft was over an hour late to Mexico. Then they said the plane is too small for any carry on luggage and it all needed to be checked down below the aircraft. I then had to transfer any all things I may need on the aircraft for my child and I into a small purse like backpack. Since the aircraft was over an hour late, it cause us to then miss our connecting flight. We rushed to customer service to try to get on another flight. The 8pm flight was booked so we needed to stay the night in Phoenix. They gave us two rooms and a $48 food voucher for four people. $48 for four people? Are you kidding me? Then we had to wake up early to make an 8 am flight, just to be told there was an aircraft change and now seats were going to be switched around and to look/refresh our boarding passes. This caused my mom to have a window seat. She’s super claustrophobic and needs an aisle seat. Luckily, a lovely young lady kindly switched seats with my mom. The staff for American Airline and American Eagle are rude, snarky, unprofessional, clearly don’t care about passengers. We will never fly this airline again. They clearly do not have their act together. This is the bottom of the barrel. Worst experience ever.   This trip has been an absolute nightmare. I was on a delayed flight every single leg of the way to my destination. Seems like there is never a sense of urgency to keep to the schedule. Even when we were able to arrive early to a destination we ended up being stuck with a gate for practically an hour. I’ve spent 14 hours traveling on, it was originally supposed to be 6 hours.   American Airlines has some very poorly trained representatives who will give you wrong information and American Airlines will not honor what the workers say. AA has no integrity to follow through with what they say. A staff member with Customer Relations is so far off from actually relating to customers and according to her there is no one who is above her to help, she is it people and she is not helpful in any way. In other words, big company taking advantage of small people. If there is a slight problem with your flight, like their airplane didn\\'t leave on time, AA will not help with connecting flights, hotel. But if you do fly AA, I hope it goes smoother for you! If you do run into issues like we did last two times we used AA and you need help they won\\'t help. Safe travels and hopefully not with AA.    Flew from Richmond to Charlotte headed to New Orleans. When I got off the plane, I realized I left my purse and told the attendant. She just stood there looking stupid. It took one of the oncoming Flight attendants to help me get them to check. Checked the wrong seat came back and said they didn\\'t see it. Was adamant they check again and they found it. Flight from Richmond to New Orleans was delayed from 9pm to 5am! Asked for a full refund because I would miss my event. They did refund my money, put me in a roach motel and gave me a flight returning back home the next morning at 7. Morning Flight was delayed again. The customer service of the staff at the Charlotte Airport is trash! I will never fly with this airline again. Could use some refresher train for the crew at this location. Was headed to a memorial but due to the lack of organization of the crew, I would have missed it. Thank you American!  The absolute worst. Had a connecting flight from Dallas, Texas to Narita, Tokyo. It was originally delayed because of some cart issue that couldn’t push the plane away from the gate. Then delayed due to a paperwork issue. Then delayed waiting for the mechanic to come on board to check the nose wheel so the aircraft was safe for takeoff. Then cancelled because the forward landing gear was damaged and wasn’t safe to fly. The staff was less than pleasant to the passengers, and they couldn’t rebook any passengers at the counter until we arrived in Narita past 10 pm because no flights depart Narita past 10 pm. So now this results in overnight in Tokyo because connecting flights aren’t even available. Every time I’ve flown with AA I’ve had either 5+ hour delays or cancellations. This is one of the most atrocious airlines I’ve ever experienced, and I’ve been a flier with AA for the past 10+ years. I’m done with this airline for the rest of my life. Infuriating.   Customers have no recourse for airlines mistakes. I purchased roundtrip tickets and upgraded (using my advantage miles) to exit row seats because i\\'m 6\\'5\" and need the extra space. Someone my height cannot sit in the regular seats without encroaching on either side of the seat, its very uncomfortable. I checked in via mobile at 4AM and everything appeared fine with the correct seat. When i checked in at the kiosk in the airport using the qr code sent to me, initially the exit row seat was shown to me and then a message popped up saying my seat had been changed. The agent at the counter said she could do nothing about it but the person at the gate could. I made it to gate A37 and when i explained the issue, she immediately started implying that i did something wrong. She first said that it appeared i changed flights, then she said i didn\\'t actually purchase the upgrade. She also said the qr code on my phone could have been created by anyone, implying i fabricated it. None of the Agents or people i talked to wanted to help. All of their answers were to try to get rid of me and push me along. The Agent at Gate A37 was the worst, using passive aggressiveness to imply i was wrong and get rid of me. When i found the email for my seat upgrade, i went back to the counter. She said she didn’t have time to help me, the seat can’t be changed and the charge would be reversed. I\\'m 6\\'5\" its not about reversing the charge, its about me purchasing an upgrade for a seat out of necessity and the Airline changing it at the last minute for no reason and thinking that money is going to fix it. Both flight attendants looked at me as if i was just complaining and the male attendant looked at me and said \"I don\\'t make the seat assignments, so what can i do, nothing\". No one cared that my knees are bad and the long 3 hour flight what hurt. No one cared that i purchased an exit row seat and it was changed. So even though i purchased seat upgrades, AA didn\\'t give a damn and everyone from the ticket agent, the gate agent and the flight attendants all have the I don\\'t care attitude.   I used American Airlines for my return flights from visiting relatives in Salt Lake City (I used Delta to get to SLC.) I had absolutely zero problems on the way with Delta; unfortunately that was not the case with AA. The boarding time was supposed to be 1:30, which ran a little bit late, resulting in me boarding at ~1:50 - not a huge deal. But once the passengers boarded, the flight was grounded for over an hour past the intended departure time due to a pre-flight inspection issue that needed fixing. Don\\'t get me wrong, I am glad that the issue was taken seriously and was fixed. But one way or another, it meant that my planned 90-minute layover (i.e. plenty of time to get to my next gate in most airports) would instead be a hectic sprint, if even possible at all. To be fair to the flight attendants, they were doing their best to help people plan their deplaning process, and of course the delay wasn\\'t their fault in the first place. I did end up making my connection, but I legitimately had to run and even then I was literally the last passenger to board the plane. Plenty of others weren\\'t so lucky. I will also say that compared to the built-in infotainment screens Delta flights have in the back of the chair in front of you, I was disappointed by AA\\'s requirement of needing to use my own device. But I usually just listen to music off my phone anyway, so that\\'s not a big deal. The first flight ultimately was passable, though just barely. However, the second flight (Charlotte into Richmond) has me angry even thinking about it now. I am not one of the most concerned people when it comes to Covid - I am young with no significant preexisting health issues - but I still do my best to wash my hands frequently and maintain a safe distance from others. With that said, even I was appalled to find that the plane was essentially full capacity, with passengers shoulder-to-shoulder, three people per three seats. Worse yet, I am currently writing this review while on my lunch break from work, struggling with potential flu-like symptoms and now having to worry if I caught it, and if I did, if I caught it on the plane. I know better than to think that airlines won\\'t do their best to make flights as full as safely possible, but it\\'s quite obvious that AA does not concern itself with keeping people safe from Covid. I will grant one positive, and that\\'s the fact that the flight landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule. But overall, I was quite disappointed with AA as an airline and will heighten an effort to stick with Delta and others in the future.   American Airlines took me from Philadelphia to Las Vegas safely and on time. The airplane was only a year and a half old and smelled like new. You know that you are a little bit more tighter inside these new planes however the design is such that you don’t really feel it, the mood lighting really helps and this five hour flight was good and time went fast. For $9.99 you can purchase Internet for the duration of the flight, I did and the Internet was very good. The crew was professional and friendly, since the flight was not full, they went around the plane to rearrange passengers, two per row instead of three, something I thought was very nice of them to take the time and do. They went around twice with free beverages and a snack, I was only expecting them to go around once. Overall a very positive experience for me compared to other carriers that fly this same route.   I have never been treated so rude in my life. This airline canceled 2 of our flights, didn’t honor the flight insurance, and refused to refund us after we had to have our flights transferred to a different airline. The customer service reps that we spoke to were disrespectful, mouthy, and down right rude. They refused to help us! The reps told us we were not allowed to speak to a manager and refused to give us their name to reference back to. We had to pay out of pocket for premium seating on a new flight, which got canceled, then upon transfer to the new airline, lost the preferred seating and they would not give us our money back. Now, I’m not one to complain, but their service was absolute trash. It’s not our fault that their employees went on strike. We are a dual military family and my husband is preparing to deploy. We wanted to spend a few days together beforehand, but that time was cut almost in half thanks to their negligence. To add insult to injury, they were rude and disrespectful. What ever happened to customer courtesy? We will never be using American Airlines again. I will pay double for tickets before I reserve a flight through this airline.   We left Columbia, SC yesterday afternoon at 4:30. We arrived to DFW expecting to fly out at 8:00 p.m. and the flight was continuously delayed every 30 minutes due to mechanical issues. We finally boarded a plane around 1:00 a.m. After sitting on this plane for 45 minutes, it was finally announced the flight was cancelled. We deboarded the plane and waited in a line of at least 150 customers in front of us trying to get rerouted, no thanks to the online option of rebooting where they wanted us to pay an extra $200. We stood in line for a good 90 minutes before they shut the line down, waiting for a new crew to come in at 3:00 a.m. At 3:15 one customer service agent arrived and was able to get us booked for a flight leaving at 6:10 to Denver, followed by a change over with united to a flight to Salt Lake City, our final destination. Our flight from unit arrived an hour ago. No bag was transferred from American Airlines. So here we sit waiting for the bag. We just learned our bag is on a different flight from DFW and will arrive shortly.  Worst customer service. We should have been home at our house last night by 11:00 p.m. and now it\\'s the next day at 11:00 ... still waiting for a bag. Unfortunately, this is not our first issue with American Airlines. Under absolutely no circumstances will we fly on this airline again. I will pay more for a competent airline that values their customers. Of note, United Airlines was more than helpful when it came to trying to hunt down our bag. We will be choosing United Airlines in the future.   Worst treatment ever. Loan and Michael at DFW were standing behind the counter talking after they asked me to approach the counter for check in. I arrived early for check in  they stood around talking for over 20 minutes and photos were taken and shown to the supervisor that came after they mistreated a deaf person. I helped the disabled person file an ada complaint and even requested security it was so bad. They refused to finish checking everyone in line in. And we all missed our flight. The staff took my phone and refused to return it. I sat on hold for an hour out of the four hours I was told I would be on hold. One attendant felt so bad she gave us all vouchers for a hotel.   A few minutes after exiting my plane in DFW, I received a gate change from terminal C way over to A. By this time, the gate attendants were gone. I rushed along the route and was finally able to snag a transit cart but did not make my connection. The cart dropped me at customer service where there was a line, including a man in a wheelchair and his relative who were in the same sinking boat as me. Since my arrival flight arrived a couple of minutes early, I was not given a hotel room. I was booked on the next flight to my destination which would not take off for 24-hrs. My destination was Connecticut, not some tiny, out-of-the-way airport. I asked and was told my checked bag would be waiting at BDL. 24 hours later, I finally made it to BDL but baggage customer service did not have my bag. The gentleman was very kind and tried to be helpful. My bag info had been switched with another passenger and apparently, my bag was back in DFW. By this time, a line of people at least 15 people long was in line for missing luggage. 15! This morning, I received a call from a very nice stranger. My suitcase had just been delivered to his house from AA in BDL. He was kind enough to drive it over to me before heading to BDL to figure out where his luggage was. My suitcase also has damage from the trip. Also, no Wi-Fi on any of my flights! Never will I use American Airlines or travel thru DFW!!!   After trying unsuccessfully to purchase a ticket online, the American app went down. When I called merely to complete my purchase, the airline increased the rate by over $900 from what I would have paid if their app worked correctly. They do not honor their online listed rates.  All aspects of our trip were fine with the exception of one - checked baggage. Our flight 2846 on June 13 had a delay of less than 15 minutes, with all staff members along the way being professional, until we retrieved our 2 checked bags. 1 bag lost its name tag, which is no big deal; however, the other bag looked as if it was assaulted by a baggage handler. Both wheels were missing, and looked as if they were torn off by a jungle predator, with clothing falling from the ripped corners. Additionally, the top handle was torn off. So the bag had to be picked up and carried flat with 2 hands. We showed the severely damaged bag to the clearly miserable airline baggage agent who replied, “Sorry, but all claims must be filed online”. Of course when going online to file the claim the policy states that reports first need to be filed at the airport. Bottom line - would definitely not check a bag again if flying American into San Francisco.  I’m no air industry / operations expert like many on here, just a frequent flyer. But from a customer perspective, I don’t see any other description for this weekend other than “meltdown”.  Call AA reservations 9am Saturday morning. Told callback will be “more than 4 hours from now”. Actual callback 8:30 pm — nearly 12 hours later. On callback at 8:30 pm, put on hold. This has never ever happened before. After 15 minutes, hung up. I’m no AA basher. But if the flights go off the board and customers can’t call for help, that is a meltdown.   Was late to board from Charleston and Dallas. Customer service was rude. Seats were uncomfortable and disregard to military. Delta and United are cheaper and better quality. T-mobile does not get free wifi inflight.  Washington, DC to Manchester, NH with American Airlines. I booked a trip, and they cancelled my flight. They did not allow a refund, just a credit until next year (during a pandemic).   Dallas Ft Worth to Miami. We booked a flight before the convid-19 virus was declared a pandemic to take a cruise on Carnival Cruise lines. We\\'ve contacted the airlines 5 times in an attempt to cancel the flight due to our cruise being cancelled and the virus outbreak and we\\'ll be going into hotspots. Every time the AA insists we wait till hours before our flight to see if it\\'s cancelled or if it will be delayed by 61 minutes. Either scenario we\\'ll receive a full refund. Beyond that we\\'ll be charged over 200 dollars for a cancellation fee. Despite our attempts to collect a full refund AA is doing all they can to ensure we receive an unfair partial refund. AA has been made aware of the fact the flight had been booked for a cruise and the cruise is cancelled. They are also aware Dallas is under a stay in place set to cancel well before/after the entire trip and well as the areas we were to travel to. They insist otherwise. I was forced.to file a.complaint with the DoT. American Airlines is still giving me the run around about a full refund   I flew back to Connecticut, from Phoenix after a family emergency. The kiosks that I printed my ticket from worked, after I tried 3 of them. There was no one at the counter to take my checked bag, so there goes $30. Wait there\\'s more, because in the bag that was supposed to be checked were a couple drinks and sunscreen. Perfectly fine as it was checked, but as I stated earlier, no one was there to check it. So there is another $20. If you are expecting to get to your flight with a checked bag you paid for, don\\'t count on it. If you want to take anything home from your trips, forget it. They will not check your bag, and then make you throw everything out because you didn\\'t check it. Thank you American, thanks for the terrible experience.   Had a chance to fly home after 6 years. Decided to trust American Airlines. Worst mistake I have ever made. Thank you for wasting what little precious moments I have with them.   Montreal to Indianapolis via Charlotte. I was not able to get on board for my connection at CLT, when they gave me my boarding pass I didn\\'t had a seat so I goes to the onboarding agent counter to ask her some questions and she told me the flight was overbooked by 17 people .... how it can possible? They wanted to give me a money compensation but I didn\\'t care about money compensation because it was a business flight so the company who I work for was paying, I missed the diner kickoff of an intern technician competition it\\'s priceless. So I was stuck in CLT, the sweet onboarding agent found me a flight on the next morning but the new American Airlines supervisor didn\\'t want to give me an hotel compensation for the night because I was supposedly not there when they call me for boarding ... but I was there 30 min before boarding. The boarding agent was arguing with him to make him understood but he didn\\'t want to understand, unacceptable! October 21th 2022, IND to MTL, I had a connection to PHL. During the night I received an email, the flight was cancelled and they give me another flight 5 hours late in the day. New connection CLT, okay fine I go to the airport, the new flight is delayed about 30min then 45, 60, 75, 120 min. Enough delayed to miss my connection to CLT. Unacceptable! The boarding agent found me a flight next morning, They give me a night at the hotel and then I took my flight on the next morning. Everybody told me to avoid American Airlines and now I understand why. Trust me I will never travel with them once it\\'s over.   Once again AA has deflated my low expectations for this carrier, a string of rude, uncaring flight attendants, counter staff and a website that is less than friendly and rarely works, how do they stay in business? The latest was to offer upgrades pre-checkin at $43 per leg, however when you apply your CC info and check in the site rejects the card (says wrong Postal Code) same postal code I entered when booking my flight.I thought simple solution I\\'ll call the reservations line.. Now the upgrade cost is $550.00 because its now after I\\'ve quote \"checked in\", however when I stated that it was their site error that created the problem it was \"Oh well that just the way it is do you want to upgrade or not\", seems like a bit like bait and switch in my opinion. This is my last AA flight, Delta is slightly more expensive on my routes but to avoid the aggravation that will be my new carrier.  American Airlines has been the most disappointing airline to ever fly. It started out with a last minute canceled flight on Sunday (2/6/22) where they thought it would be okay to re-book the flight on Tuesday (2 days later). Unacceptable. After working with our travel agent and spending 3+ hours standing in line we were finally able to get a flight to the US routed to Boston with an overnight layover. Next morning we are standing in line at 2am (an hour before they open). None-the-less, their disorganization has us standing at the front of line until 4am when they finally are able to service us. At this point we are missing work etc.. they have many seats open on a flight which would be ideal and their phone customer service representative has assured us it will not be an issue. Still, they cannot figure out in-person how to correct our flight which leads to another long delay with incompetent staff. We have now been traveling for over 24 hours and are extremely exhausted. Moving forward I will pay triple to fly any other airline with competent staff and consideration for their customers. I’ve never experienced a service like this.   Due to the pandemic I had to cancel my trip, they told me I had a year to rebook from the date of cancellation! This was last October. I just tried to rebook and they said my tickets expired March 31st! No where on my flight credit did it ever have an expiration date, and in fact it says “Active” on mine and my husbands accounts. So the rudest “customer service” person I have dealt with at this airline there is nothing I can do and no one I can talk to, so basically I am out of $2,176 - it is bad enough that the airlines have basically zero care for their passengers, but this is outright theft! Never again will I use this airline.   Arrived 1.45 hours before flight. Missed flight due to check in staff unable to process a short line of people in an efficient manner. Watched 6 check in staff unable to process a short line of 20 people in 45 minutes. The incompetence was astounding to have missed a flight due to a simple process of checking people in. Instead they dilly dallied on just a few customers never thinking nor caring that they are making others miss their flights. I don\\'t believe they are unaware of their actions. They simply don\\'t give a damn.   What a worthless airline. Wife and I were supposed to fly from Seattle Friday night and land in Paris Saturday afternoon. Our Viking excursions included a Saturday/Sunday hotel with two walking excursions starting Sunday at 9:00am. An hour before our flight we were informed of a two hour delay, then we found out we were going to New York. When we got to New York they were going to put us on a flight to London arriving in Paris Sunday am. I said \"no\" and got a flight from New York to Paris arriving by 7:00am Sunday. We had an 11 hour layover in New York, American didn\\'t give us a room to sleep and when I filed a $599 claim with them (lost Saturday evening hotel room in Paris) it took them weeks to finally give us two $125 trip credits for a future American Airlines flight - THAT\\'S $349 LESS THAN OUR MONETARY DAMAGES AND IT WOULD FORCE US TO FLY AMERICAN WHICH WE\\'LL AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE! BTW - the pilot said that the reason for the delay and then changed flight to New York was that the aircraft had two required communications devices on board for Atlantic crossings, but neither of them worked. This is basic negligence.    American Airlines is the worst. They had issues while we were on the plane & had us wait 1 hour & 30mins while they figure out what’s wrong it so we can pull off. I made it to Dallas just on time for my 2nd flight to Houston - at least that’s what I thought and they closed the flight 15 minutes early. So I had to wait til 6:00pm for another flight. In between that I tried to talk to a supervisor on who was very unprofessional. I asked to talk to someone higher than him due to his attitude. He was waving us away as if we aren’t paying customers he specifically told me I’m not getting anyone higher than him. I can’t believe we are being treated like this. Never again.  I was booked on the last flight getting me from Orlando to Charlotte. My meetings ended early so I called the Platinum desk to see what earlier flights there might be, and they told me to go to the airport, which was where they should be able to make the change (any earlier flight was \"wide open\" for space). I have 2.5 million miles and lifetime Platinum status with the airline. Once at the airport upon check in the gate agent could not help even after checking with a supervisor because of their policy to not change flights, even though the earlier flight was \"wide open\" in terms of space, as it was company \"Policy\". She did suggest I try at the \"special services\" desk near my anticipated gate for the earlier flight. Their the gentlemen with a cold stare told me I would have to wait for the later flight, because he was unable to make the change because of \"policy\", unless I paid the $390 (more than my entire trip) change fee to get on a plane that was \"wide open\". He also informed me I would need to call the agent that booked it for me. I called the agent who asked me why American had not put me on stand by with my Platinum status. I had already asked the same question. The agent made the change for $250, and then when I went to the gate to get my new ticket, they informed me he had not processed the payment which I know had happened, and would not listen to the booking travel agent on the speaker phone, as they constantly interrupted him. So with minutes to spare he issued me a one-way ticket and then he sorted it out with American Airlines the next day. They of course were in error. So tomorrow I am flying back to Orlando, and once again my day will be ending earlier than anticipated. But today American Airlines has my original flight for tomorrow oversold, and wants to know if I would move to another flight. I am disgusted with not just the policy, but with how a number of desk agents at the Orlando airport treated me. Even the supervisor would not hear me out at \"Special Services\", this department should be call \"Stick to Policy\" unless of course it might help out American Airlines. Forget about helping a customer who has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on flights. I do have to commend the flight crew who were very friendly. I had stopped using American for a while because of bad service, and since moving to Orlando I thought I would give them another chance. Well needless to say, I guess I will avoid the flights again with American. If this is how they treat someone who has flown a lot with them, I cannot imagine how they treat casual travelers. I have tried to submit compliments and complaints to American Airlines in the past, and have never heard back from them. I doubt I will hear from them this time either.  Let’s play a game. Close your eyes. You\\'re at a busy airport waiting for your departure. Static, then an overhead announcement that your flight is delayed because the airlines doesn\\'t have a plane. Which airlines are you on? If you said American, you win! The average flight delay for American is 57 minutes. Here\\'s another number. 18. Today, 18 people on our flight missed their connecting flight from Philadelphia to Athens, also an American flight. We were told \"if you hurry, you\\'ll make it\". Yet none of us did. The two terminals were miles apart. No transportation was offered or provided. And *that* flight left on time. We were rerouted through London and Frankfurt. The American agent told us we\\'d have plenty of time to make connections but did not factor in clearing customs in Frankfurt. So we missed that flight too, not by a little, by a lot. As I write this I am in Frankfurt with no way to get to Athens until (perhaps) tomorrow. Our tour left without us--everyone who didn\\'t fly American was present and accounted for. Since I don\\'t work for American I have to return to work on time and on schedule. I can\\'t tack a couple days on to this vacation. So, if you have no choice but to fly American, stay home. And American, change your name. Latvian Airlines. Azerbaijan Airlines. Anything but America--you\\'re embarrassing all of us.   My 2 girlfriends and I are stuck in Miami for the next 2 nights, without a hotel and without our luggage due to a flight cancellation. The AA manager at the Miami airport told us that they are unable to provide us hotel vouchers because all of the hotels they are allowed to use are full. We asked him if we are supposed to sleep on the street in Miami for the next 2 nights (all flights are booked for the next 2 days), and he said “yes” there’s nothing he can do. He refused to provide our group anything in writing so we can receive compensation for taxi, rental car, food, new airline tickets or a hotel, if we can even find one.   Percentage of American Airline flights on time: 81.45 percent. Percentage of American Airline flights that are late or canceled: 18.55 percent. As the world\\'s largest carrier by fleet size, passengers carried, and passenger revenue, American Airlines has nearly 6,800 flights daily to 350 destinations. However, according to data from the BTS, almost 19 percent of them are delayed or canceled. Flight leaving MSY was delayed by 45 minutes, then waited at the gate for 90 minutes while 1 baggage handler to load 10X the amount of luggage compared to those on the aircraft, landed late to Chicago O\\' Hare, but had just enough time to get to the gate for the connecting flight, only to find out American Airlines gave away my seat to a standby passenger, and cancelled my boarding pass, the next flight from Chicago to Minneapolis was not until the next day, I purchased a one way ticket from Delta, do not book your travel with American Airlines, you will be disappointed.   Our flight was changed due to a scheduling error where AA book a flight where we would miss our connection. Instead of fixing it, they change the destination completely to Raleigh Durham. Our plan was to drive from Fayetteville to Myrtle Beach with family. When asked since they changed the destination could we just get a final destination to Myrtle Beach instead, they claimed those flights were sold out and no available Fayetteville flights were left. So we have to take the destination change to a city completely out of the way and on top of that, it’s currently scheduled to be delayed as well. Also, flights to regional airports are more expensive than flights to international. No offer to reimburse, no offer to upgrade seats, no offer to waive checked bag fees, just “we’re sorry about that, that’s best we can do.”   American Airlines delayed two flights on my trip. When trying to gain access standby to not miss a connection flight they put airline personnel on the plane instead and let me miss my connection. AA app didn’t work so you couldn’t watch any entertainment. They also wanted to charge for every detail of the flight including putting my kids next to me on the flight.   I have been flying since 1982 and have used different airlines until recently we have used American exclusively for the past 5 years. Our trip home from Charlotte NC to Springfield Mo 12/27/21 was the most pleasant due to the on board flight attendant named Jodie. She was the most professional, friendly and informative person we have ever dealt with with our air travel. Things like making sure we all knew the new safety rules, making sure we were comfortable, even letting us all know that the head rests could be adjusted for more comfort. Jodie also went out of her way to make we had juices and snacks we wanted. Finally, her tone of voice over the cabin speaker was excellent. Clear speaking and enthusiastic about what we could expect before, during and after the flight. I can honestly say I have never seen a flight attendant act and seem to love her job more than Jodie. Also, no issues at all flying with American over the Thanksgiving period and then again Christmas day eve then returning the Monday after Christmas. I hope this review gets to management so she can be rewarded for her fine job representing American Airlines.   Kaira, at Gate B17 at 2130 was a great help. She worked all day, but was still respectful. A colleague and I had a last minute work trip and missed our prior flight. When we arrived, there was no one at the any of the blue change flight kiosks. She took our standby tickets and gave us actual seats. Care and kindness are a dwindling commodity in our current post pandemic society. She did a great job and is a great reflection of the atmosphere of her organization. Thank you for your humanity.   I’m never flying American again. Due to the incompetence of staff I was late for my outgoing flight because they did not know how to check a dog. They took their time trying to figure it out and even though I was early I still missed my flight. I am currently returning and receiving the worst possible service of my life. I have never been so dissatisfied with any airline and I will never even look at another American ticket.   Very good experience. Nice people and what a aircraft! Had a 14 hour fight but enjoyed every moment of it. The plane was nice and modern - thank you American Airlines   Cancelled First class tickets and didn\\'t refund. American Airlines has not responded or acknowledged and it has been 45 days now. I have attempted to contact them many times but after hours of waiting on hold their customer support says that they don’t handle refunds and they don’t respond to emails or fax. I believe this is a clear violation of my rights as they have not refunded me for first class tickets that they cancelled.   Don\\'t waste your time or money on American Airlines. Flew into Buffalo for a 425pm NFL game. flight was changed at the last minute with no prior notice causing us to arrive in Buffalo at 345pm rather than 11am. We arrived late for our event. Did absolutely nothing to accommodate the massive inconvenience. DO NOT book through priceline either, terrible customer service. Neither company cares about their customers only their profits.   Do not ever fly on this airline. They have the rudest, worst customer service ever. They will not let you pick your seat and when you call about it, they are rude and unhelpful. Two days fighting to get a seat assigned. Do Not, I repeat, Do Not, fly on this airline. Spare yourself the aggravation. Don’t give them money, no matter how inexpensive their offer is. It is not worth it. Reward airlines who are doing it right. They are a disgrace to the airline world. You have seen the videos of them kicking paying customers off planes for speaking up and demanding what they paid for. Do not reward this behaviour.  Just now If I could rate no stars- I would. This one star is extremely generous after the negative experience I had today (after being a member with them for years.) I was denied my flight to Jamaica although I had all the correct paperwork and documents. The supervisor was not willing to help me- nor very helpful and ignored me while I was waiting for her to come back. I wasted a lot of money on Uber going back-and-forth to get the correct documents for her, experienced extreme stress, and time wasted. Due to being denied- I cannot attend a very important meeting I invested in. I did not feel like a valued customer and will not book my future flights with them- not to mention the last two flights I had w/ them (2 weeks ago) were extremely crowded and did not follow safe social distancing guidelines. Each row was packed with people, they had no issue booking a full flight and I feel as if they were so interested in following government guidelines with my paperwork, they would be responsibly distancing their “valued” guest as well.   So on the morning of May 22, my wife and I were leaving for our honeymoon and after checking in they told us upstairs that our bags were fine to be carry on. After getting to the desk to board a young lady had the nastiest attitude towards us that was uncalled for. Seeing as though we are the paying customer like everyone else, if she didn’t want to work today she could’ve just stayed home. She wouldn’t give us her name so another worker stepped in to help us get on board and just checked our bags in. She stated whoever downstairs didn’t do their job if they let y’all up here with those bags. My reply was maybe it’s you not doin yours and being extra today waking up on the wrong side of the bed. Nonetheless never would we ride this airline again. \\xa0 \\xa0Because I had left my wallet, I could not proceed with ticking at the airport. Ms. Renata helped me to proceed with my ticketing so I could take the plane from Dallas to Phoenix on April 5th. I am grateful for Ms. Renata, and I recommend that she be recognized as the best employee.   I was flying with my siblings home from Arizona after our mom had passed away. We were tired, very emotional, and sad after an exhausting week. Upon checking in and letting them know we had our mothers remains we were shocked at the horrible customer service we received. I had called to see if there were any requirements to fly with remains and was told yes! Various paperwork had to be obtained, remains must be in carry on , etc. We followed all instructions only to find out upon check in “they didn’t care about any of that!” We were also told we could put remains in our checked bag so I did that, of course not wanting to carry an urn on the plane. The women checking us in was extremely rude. She never said sorry for your loss or anything. She then weighed my bag after she told to put the urn in my checked bag and charged me $100 extra for being 6 lbs over. When I asked about the price she said \"well you can start taking stuff out but good luck with it\". I wasn’t going to argue and just told her I would call when I got home. I did call and was told “ oh well that’s the policy for overweight baggage “ The employees have no empathy or sympathy! I will never fly with them again and neither will my family after the way we were treated!   This will be the last time I fly with this airline. Don’t even bother trying to change anything or reschedule. You’re not going to get what you’re looking for, they’ll charge you for any reason they can think of, and you’ll probably end up with a voucher at best. It’s May ... customers are required to wear masks, but American Airlines disregards the social distancing measures. It’s business as usual, jamming people onto crowded planes like sardines amidst a pandemic. They won’t serve you a hot meal, don’t offer snacks and you can’t buy alcohol.   The customer service we experienced during this flight was so awful, that I will pay double to fly a different airline in the future. Our flight was delayed several hours, then canceled, then rescheduled a day later. Connecting flights were missed with the customer help people emailing us wrong information for our rebooked flights. This took over an hour on the phone at 02:00. We found out we were not actually booked on our next rebooked connecting flight when we got to the gate to board. We were not given updates by text or email, bounced around between American and their subsidiaries, told we couldn’t be helped, sent all over the airport to be told there was nothing they could do. No one cares, with an employee telling us American Airlines is the lowest paying airline. AA doesn’t care, your employees don’t care. I regret giving your company thousands of dollars for the worst service I’ve ever experienced and losing a couple precious days of our trip. You should be embarrassed by this representation of your company. The worst thing about this is what we’ve lost, time, which is irreplaceable.   Absolutely horrid experience. They made us check in our carry on bag because they \"ran out of space\" even after we told them that we have a very close connecting flight and our bags won\\'t make it if they are checked in. The American Airlines representative working the desk said \"I do not care you are checking your carry on\" and was overall very rude about the whole thing. Of course, the bags didn\\'t make it and were delayed for a day of our trip. We had to go out and buy necessities instead of enjoying the sun on the first day. The same thing happened on the returning flight but whatever, we have other stuff at home. We kept our receipts and needed help filing a claim so we called customer support who said we can\\'t speak to a representative because we don\\'t have a claim? So after having to translate every item on every receipt from Spanish and listing them out on my claim I can\\'t speak to an agent. Garbage airline would literally pay extra money to fly anything else.   The flight was punctual, and the cabin crew was friendly and attentive. The in-flight service exceeded my expectations, with delicious meal and complimentary beverages. The seating was comfortable, and the entertainment options made the journey enjoyable. What impressed me the most was the proactive communication from the airline about any potential delays.   Terrible paid extra for aisle seat was stuck in the middle seat 2 times after paying substantial amount for more space, paid for exit row was put in very back of plane. Second they packed their flights all of them were 110% full with standbys and upgrades requests numbering 2 pages of names ... then they get irate about not observing the 6’ rule and all the garbage about social distance! If you pack your flights you most certainly are not adhering to rules and guidelines! And their service sucks.   Halfway through the first leg of our flight the crew ran out of champagne (first order) and without any explanation they substituted wine and only admitted problem after I called them back. They then ran out of food and only option offered was dried out inedible chicken. At our 2 hour layover the food and drinks were not restocked on the plane and we reboarded the same plane in the same seat. I cannot believe that in first class food and drinks were allowed to run out and not restocked although there were over 2 hours that they could have done it. This was a long and expensive first class flight that was very disappointing. To add to the lack of food the stewardess were not organized. The service was done in shifts. First row. Then about 5 to 10 minutes then 2nd row. We were in the last row of first and business class (5) total and the people in the first three rows had finished eating by the time we were told that there was no food for us after all. Sorry do you want snacks. For the price we paid to sit in business class I thought that was very disappointing. I had chips for lunch…   I accidentally bought a checked bag because I was confused with the new terms. I was allowed a carry on so I immediately tried to cancel it. I wasted one hr of my life with a robot and virtual agent only to be told I could then schedule a call back appointment with an agent 4 hrs later. After a half hour of that bullshit with someone who could do nothing I waited another half hour for a supervisor who said sorry, no refund.   I will never fly AA again. Dirty planes packed to the brim. No mask enforcement. No distancing. No nothing. Lip service to safety only. They just want your money. They don\\'t care about your well being or your experience. This much is plain.  We were supposed to fly from San Diego to Dallas on Friday afternoon for the weekend. They cancelled our flight when we were on our way to the airport...due to expected weather in Dallas. Our friends took Southwest Airlines and made it to Dallas. Their flight was delayed, but was not cancelled. So now we\\'re not getting in to Dallas until Saturday 1.00, and returning Sunday evening. I can understand if all flights are cancelled due to weather. But other airlines are still flying. American must not have great pilots. Never ever will I choose American over Southwest again.   The whole plane was packed to the max. No spaces between seats. Strangers were seated next to each other. My first flight they put put me along with another person, when my seat was by window. The next flight whole plane was packed in each seat. I had to sit between two strangers. One was immuno compromised and she looked like in a bad shape. I asked the airline hostess if she had empty seats on the airplane, and she said \"no\". They also told everyone no snacks or drinks will be served. I kept myself under the mask the whole time. The plane was door had to be fixed and it kept making loud sounds when taking off and landing. When I was going to get my bags, me and another lady were discussing how packed these flights are.  The whole crew kept walking back and forth with garbage bags. When they did not serve any drinks or food, why garbage?   I have been flying American for two decades and am aware of the frequent criticism. My wife and I recently flew to London on American on then on Zurich on British Air. We returned from Amsterdam to Philadelphia on American with a six hour lay over for our flight on Boston also on American. I would say that consistently American employees, whether checking us in, at the gate, or on the aircraft were helpful and friendly. Because of a leg injury my wife required a wheelchair, which was always provided with a helpful assistant in each location. Business class over was fine, and my choice of dinner was excellent. Breakfast was also good. On our return flight from Amsterdam to Philadelphia, we were comfortable in premium economy, found the choice of movies interesting, most of the attendants helpful. particularly in trying to remove the entertainment control from its location in the arm. The food was fine, the ice cream snack mid-flight was a nice touch. The staff in the Admirals Clubs were always cheerful and helpful. It may be true that dissatisfied fliers are more inclined to write a review, but we were very satisfied.   I had a truly horrendous traveling experience with American Airlines on my return flight from Newark to DFW. My flight was scheduled for 6:30 pm, and I arrived at the airport at 4 pm to go through the tedious security check. Upon reaching the gate, I was informed that my flight was delayed by an hour. As time passed, the delay kept extending, and we were eventually told that we would only be boarding the plane at around 9:45 pm to 10 pm. After boarding and taxiing for half an hour, the pilot announced that they had exceeded their allowed hours, and we would have to go back to the terminal. It was incredibly frustrating to have to go through the entire boarding process only to be turned back due to an issue that should have been sorted out beforehand. Upon returning to the terminal, we were informed that the flight had been canceled, and we would have to wait until the next day to fly out at 11:15 am. The process of waiting in line at the AA counter to secure a hotel reservation for the night was a frustrating two-hour ordeal. When I finally arrived at the hotel, I was informed that they had not received any information about my reservation. Luckily, they had a room available, but it was an unnecessary inconvenience after an already stressful day. The next day, we arrived at the airport at 8 am, went through security again, and boarded the plane. However, after only half an hour, we were informed that there was a technical issue with the plane, and we had to disembark yet again. I was fed up with the constant delays and decided to book a flight with United while waiting in line for a refund. The whole ordeal cost me $850 for a one-way ticket for myself and my wife. Overall, this experience was a complete nightmare, and I have decided never to travel with American Airlines again. I will make sure to share my experience with anyone who asks for recommendations.   I had booked this back in March when I heard that AA were using their B-777-300 aircraft on the MIA-LAX-MIA route. They market it as Flagship Service which is supposed to be a domestic version of their International premium service. Due to Covid the Flagship Lounge in Miami was closed but they let me use the Admiral\\'s Club, which was fine. The plane was completely full with no sort of control at the gate when boarding in Miami. Once onboard my seat was fine and the service was as well. Still no glassware. Meal was good and after extending the seat into bed mode I slept. My complaint was that there was no pillow and no blanket for a flight that AA market as Flagship Service - their premier product domestically. For Flagship Business passengers on a flight over 5 hours where people have the option to sleep in a flat bed AA should provide pillows and blankets. I mentioned this to a female F/A and she told me to write to American Airlines, which I did not do because all I\\'ll get is flowery reply blaming it all on Covid. I will use this service again because I like flying the B-777-300 but will bring along a blanket and pillow.   I have already written two other reviews here about this trip. I am writing a third review to let everyone know the results of my lawsuit against American Airlines. Hopefully these facts will help you in deciding to fly with them. I brought a suit in small claims court, because American denied two refund requests after they cancelled my flight. They claimed that no seats were available to continue my trip for 5 days. This stranded me at DFW. I sued for the price of my ticket plus my lost non-refundable lodging and other fees at my final destination. I also sued for punitive damages due to their two denials of my refund. Within three days after I had them served with the court summons, I received an e-mail that they had approved the refund of my ticket. I lost the case. American, like all other airlines, has themselves insulated against claims like mine in huge volumes of tariffs and other legal documents. When you purchase a ticket and check the box that you agree to their terms and conditions, you are agreeing to their \"terms of carriage,\" which is a contract. Since the hearing was a breach of contract case, the judge dismissed punitive damages. She also found that they were not in breach of contract. If you fly with these people, you are at their mercy.  American Airlines is an 8.8 billion dollar company that can’t figure out how to function. I fully believe there needs to be an investigation launched. They never get flights off the ground on time. They strand passengers in foreign countries. They cause people to miss work and sleep and do not care. Their staff are grossly underpaid and it shows in how uninterested they are in doing their jobs. They cost me two days of earned wages and left me with a pinched nerve in my neck. They told me to contact customer service for which I was on hold for SEVENTEEN HOURS. Do NOT fly AA. It is not worth it and they do not deserve a single penny more until they can pay competent staff. Pay a little more and actually get to your destination. I lost more money than I saved because of American Airlines.   This was my third time flying American Airlines this month and my first time flying in a business class cabin since they reinstated full service and my experience was excellent. Since we had a short taxi, the pre-departure beverage was not offered. However, once we got up in the air it was quickly served with warm mix nuts. For dinner we had a delicious beef dinner with macaroni and cheese, a mixed salad, a small side shrimp aperitive, warm rolls, and a little ice cream tub for dessert. If you watch a small commercial, you’re even got 20 minutes of free, high-speed Internet, which was enough for me to send a few messages. The airplane was only six years old and very well-kept. I really don’t understand what all the negative comments are about, three times on AmericanAirlines in one month, and I have had very positive experiences. I will fly them again soon.   I rarely write reviews but, I will never fly American Airlines again. I am very uncomfortable with their lack of enforcing social distancing practices. It is a completely full flight and I am sitting all around people I don’t know. Multiple people are “wearing” face coverings with their noses out! Face coverings don’t work if your mouth and nose aren’t covered. At the gate, several people around me were not wearing their masks all. And they did an incredibly poor job when calling group numbers to board. They called numbers together causing people to “herd” next to each other trying to get on the plane. There was no mention of the airline having cleaned our seats and surfaces. I flew Jet Blue yesterday and it was 100% different. They left middle seats open. Ensured passengers had their face coverings on and informed us wash individual set and surface had been cleaned.   If you want your flight delayed or canceled book American Airlines. This was an absolutely terrible experience. My flight was delayed for over an hour. Tons of peoples flights canceled all in time for Christmas.   Suitcase was lost in my travel to Pereira, Colombia. American Airlines will not reimburse me as no claim number exists. The American Airlines agent in Colombia provided me with documents reflecting the loss; however, he did not generate a claim number which American Airlines is now requesting. I have provided AA with all the completed documents provided by their agent; however, American Airlines will not reimburse me because it is policy and procedure that without a claim number reimbursement cannot be completed. I am disappointed in AA\\'s handling of this incident when their own employee did not comply with their policy and procedures.   This was my first flight and I wasn’t sure what to expect. I have heard negative reviews about Airlines, but my flight going and coming surpassed my expectations. The flight attendants on each flight was friendly, informative, attentive and very professional. I plan on flying again in the near future, I hope experience the same type of customer service again! I work in the healthcare field and providing great customer service goes a long way. Keep up the great job even during the pandemic.  I purchased a ticket for my elderly mother and I received a gate pass to take her to the correct gate. From the lady at check in (who I would’ve been lost without) to the gentleman at the gate who personally walked her to her seat, I could not have asked for better assistance. Both of these wonderful people went out of their way to made a difficult situation enjoyable. Thank you! Wonderful customer service!  My family and I traveled on American Airlines back home from Pittsburgh where we were visiting family for two weeks. This was our first time with our 3+ month old newborn and as I understood it, we were allowed priority boarding because we had a baby so young in age. Little did we know that the agents didn\\'t seem to care with regard to this. Regardless of this they still made us wait to board once we connected in Phoenix. Leaving Pittsburgh wasn\\'t so bad but we still had to fight our way through the massive line to get to the front. This was on New Years Day which I understand is going to be a little hectic but the airline did no way of organizing passengers, everyone marched forward like cattle on a farm waiting to come off the fields at night. I will add that years ago I remember infants and small children being announced over the PA system clearly when it was time to board. Flying sure has changed. For the worst. One woman ahead of us tried to board with her infants and was turned around saying \"sorry not your group yet\", no sincerity whatsoever from the attendant. Seems all they want to do is pack us on like sardines in a can. You can\\'t even understand what they say on the intercoms anymore. Just a bunch of distortion and crackling with a small discerption of someone\\'s voice barely coming through. The woman ahead of us with the children said she had better experience with Delta and would be going back to them for future flights. Might think of doing that next time ourselves as American Airlines seems to have fallen off the deep end.   Very smooth flight, left and arrived on time. Staff makes a more professional impression than United. On board entertainment is pretty limited, but works well.   This review is about my 82 year old mother. She has multiple health issues and we always ask that she receive wheelchair assistance. This last trip, leaving Dallas, her gate was changed four different times. And somewhere between the third and fourth time, she was forgotten about and left at the third gate and almost missed her plane. On top of that they had borrowed the wheelchair she was sitting in and she had to run as fast as she could to try to make her flight. My mom has COPD and does not walk long distances so this was quite the experience for her. That was her trip from Dallas. On her return flight from Buffalo, they had her sitting on the plane for six hours before the plane took off. My mom is diabetic she had not had anything to eat since 11 that day, and thought she would be home in time to have dinner. So basically they held all those people hostage on the plane for six hours including my mother. Eventually my sister called up there and the people were allowed to leave to go get something to eat. I cannot believe this is the way this airline works. I have never been so disappointed in an airline. and if there is any way to avoid it in the future neither myself nor anyone I know will be flying this airline.  They have changed my flight over and over. It\\'s been 24hrs and I am still trying to get home. I will never fly AA again. They have been less than accommodating. They don\\'t care that they just cancel flights minutes before take off. The reason was \"too much air traffic\". Then the next flight they gave me without compensation was delayed. It\\'s out of hand. Traveling for days when it could be a simple 3-4hr flight.  What a joke! Old aircraft, horrible seats, horrible meals, horrible in-air service (had to ask for water each time), horrible timing and a horrible pilot, who could not make up for 1-hour delay during a 9-hour flight! This is appalling and disrespectful to say the least. Don’t fly this joke of an airline.   I had a flight booked from New Orleans to Omaha. When I arrived in Dallas, American informed us that our flight to Omaha had been cancelled. I then proceeded to go to the counter to see about putting me on another flight. There was approximately 200 people in line waiting to do the same. Around midnight they decided to close the window and made an announcement that the window is closed and we would have to come back in the morning. I had to stay at the airport all night since their was no hotel rooms available. Their website says the flight had been changed to Tuesday, for the record this is Sunday. I then called the 800 number to see about booking a different flight. I was on hold for more then 2 hours with no response. I then booked another airline to fly home on Monday. Still trying to cancel the flight from Dallas to Omaha with no success since no one will answer the phone. The flight was initially booked with Expedia since American cancelled the flight they informed me that I have to cancel it with American. I would if they would answer their phones. This is the most ridiculous experience with an airline in my life. I will never fly with American Airlines again. Their customer service is a joke.   American Airlines must change its catering. On every recent flight, in first or business, food was inedible, wine was not drinkable, and overall service was lacking. Flight attendants take the heat, it\\'s not their fault, the airline food and beverage program is mismanaged and grossly unacceptable. International flights should be a step up, not down as AA is.   This will absolutely be my very last trip on American Airlines. It is worth the extra few dollars to fly with Delta, a reliable, consistent and customer service focused airline. Prior to my departure today on flight 2612, I spoke to an agent at Bradley Airport about getting seats changed for my Atlanta flight because my husband and I were not seated together. She advised that they would do it at the Charlotte gate and that the flight had plenty of open seats. Once I got to Charlotte, I approached the counter at the gate to inquire about available sets since my husband and I were not seated together. Instead of there being a response and/or acknowledgement of NY inquiry, the agent simply ignored me. She never looked up and never acknowledged my presence. However, a pilot and several crew stepped up to the right for her to board and to the contrary, she very politely greeted and giggled with them. Finally, after roughly 2 to 3 minutes passed, the agent finally asked if she could help. I then asked if there were exit row seats because we are tall and were happy to pay. She said NO, that there were none. She said that there are other seats to switch us to at a fee. I advised that I was ok with the fee. She then charged me $20.11 for one seat and $26.75 for the other. I was fine with this. If we could not have the legroom because there were not exit rows open, at least my husband and I would be seated together. However, upon boarding the plane, not only did I see many, rows of open seats but also that there were open EXIT row seats on rows 17 and 18 - though she told me there were none. I then went on to see the flight attendants moving passengers at no cost to the many open rows. A woman was moved up to the empty rows in sections 18abc. Another gentleman was moved up to the empty rows of 19def and many others. My obvious concerns are 1- That I was ignored for 3 minutes at the counter by the agent. 2 - That I was told that there were NO exit row seats open and there were. 3 - That I was made to PAY for seat changes, when other passengers were given the option to move at will and at no cost. 4- That this agent was aware that the flight was not full, yet made no attempt to accommodate my move. As mentioned earlier, I spoke to another agent who advised me to make the change at the gate. She said there should be absolutely no issue with my request, as there were \"plenty\" of open seats. Long and short of this review is that I was treated unequally.  I am livid!   I was on my honeymoon and we had an upgrade for first class for both my wife and I. Her ticket didn\\'t upgrade so they gave us two other seats not in first class and we went back to our original seats. American charged my card for my upgrade but told me that it would be refunded since I did not sit in First Class and went back to sit with my new wife since it was theirc computer that messed up and did not give us both First Class tickets. They will not refund my upgrade purchase of $720.00. I keep calling customer service but they won\\'t help, they say I have to put the the request in online. When I do that, it says pending and has said pending for 6+ months. I have a high status with American and pay for Lounge access. I would have never thought they would steal $720.00 like this.  Horrible customer service. Weather in Tulsa forces us to land in Memphis at 12 midnight. This is uncontrollable and understandable. In Memphis we were told to wait. We waited until 1am then we were told flight will not leave until tomorrow at 11am and we were to move to the airport lobby and stay there due to no hotels. Many of us booked our own hotel. There were many rooms available. American, wake up, people don’t want to be treated this way.   We were scheduled to leave the house around 5 am to catch our flight maybe a half hour before hand our flight was canceled. It took over 6 hours to get a phone call from AA. They wanted to put us on the next flight (2 days later) and in economy when we paid for business. Who would pay for our 2 days of not being there? It was a fight to get our money back. After spending hours on the phone it still wasn\\'t refunded correctly. Maybe about 5-6 calls later and about a month later we got our refund. Keep in mind it wasn\\'t the full amount. They were short by $30 claiming it was a tourism fee. Keep in mind we never went, so why would they have to pay it yet? Bottom line, never again. A vacation turned into a nightmare! We never got our vacation we planned 4 months in advance.   When we arrived at the check-in counter, the airline representative stated that a balance of over $2000 was owed for our tickets and we would be required to pay the balance before being given boarding passes or allowed to board the flight. I explained to the customer services representative that these tickets were originally purchased and paid in full in February 2020 and due to COVID19, the original flight had to be canceled and rebooked. Since the rebooking, AA had also made flight changes on their end, the most recent change being in early November. The end result of said changes was two round trip flights paid in full plus two $130 refund vouchers for the difference in price of our original flight, which can be confirmed by review of our AA accounts. I did not volunteer to pay the balance as I had already received seat assignments and confirmation numbers as well as refund vouchers which further proved we had paid in full. Despite our pleas with the customer service agent and her Supervisor, we were told there was nothing they could do for us. It took over 1½ hours for these customer service agents to sort out the error in the AA system that was denying us boarding passes. When finally someone on the phone was able to walk the agent through voiding the error and permitting us access, it was too late. Prior to missing our flight, when the service agent realized the error was entirely on AA ticketing system, we were told that if we hurried through security, they would notify the gate that we were on our way and he would check the oversized bag at the gate. We were instructed to take our checked bag through security (without boarding passes in hand) and that he would meet us on the other side to inform security of our situation and the reason for needing to take our oversized bag through. We rushed up to security and were forced to explain our situation again as staff was nowhere to be seen. I declared to TSA that I had scuba diving gear, including a diving knife in the oversized bag. At that point, we were held up by TSA to investigate why we were bringing a knife through security. At that time, staff finally did show up and explained to TSA that he had instructed us to bring our bag through. TSA forced me to forfeit my scuba knife before allowing us to leave security and proceed to run to our gate. TSA allowed us to ONLY forfeit the knife but explained to us that under any other circumstance and by protocol we would have been detained with SD Harbor Police. As you can imagine, this was extremely uncomfortable. When we arrived at our gate, it had already been closed and was preparing for take-off. We sat in the airport, defeated, demoralized, shaking, and crying about what we were just subjected to. To top off the ordeal, the staff walked away from us and blamed missing our flight on us bringing a knife through security. We had never intended to bring the oversized bag with scuba gear through security, it was supposed to be checked. This was no fault of our own, we were only doing what we were told to do after American Airlines had failed us. We were not given a statement describing our rights and explaining what to do if the carrier bumps you from a flight at no fault of your own. We were told by the customer service agent that our only option was to write a letter to AA.com. Ultimately we arrived 24 hours after my original arrival time.   The horrible incompetence of this airline, which left Dallas hours late to Houston to pick us up in Houston, meant that connecting flights were missed, ruining the first half of my spring vacation. I will never book with American again, because they put you on these regional airlines without your knowledge, and these regional airlines are notoriously poor. The couple waiting next to me missed their flight to LA so that they couldn’t get their flight to Bali.   Orlando to Philadelphia. Terrible! Worst airline ever! My flight was delayed 2-1/2 hours from Orlando to Philly, the captain held us in a plane which we could get out to get fresh air or stay inside the airport. Seating is horrible, very uncomfortable. Unbelievable, after sitting in 2-1/2 hours, our flight took off at 7pm and my connecting flight from Philly to PVD supposedly at 8:45pm, we landed in Philly at 8:40pm and missed my flight to PVD. I was upset, I was so exhausted from being delayed in the first place. I went to AA customer service, I talked to a lady at gate A17, she told me there are no more flights to PVD at night so I have to stay at the airport until 2 pm the next day. I was in tears and I told her that I have health issues and I need to take my medicine. She said that I should have them in your person. She was rude and not sympathetic and she said, these things happen. The other two women heard my conversation and I was short of breath and they told me to sit down and they are helping me to get an early flight which is \"stand by\" for 11 am the next day. I wish I had their names to thank them again. They offered me a hotel to stay in and a $12 food voucher for that hotel. Most of American Airlines staff and Philly staff are not helpful to the travelers. I hope I never have to connect in Philly again. I will never fly or recommend this airline ever. A lot of angry travelers so I won’t fly cheap anymore, lesson learned, Jetblue, Southwest or Delta all the way. Paying the extra it’s worth it. I\\'d rather walk than fly Frontier Airlines or American Airlines. My ticket to fly was cheaper than my bags. They make you pay for even a carry-on and that\\'s ridiculous. The money you \"save\" is not worth the headache you get when you fly this airline. Unsatisfactory situation.   This flight was supposed to leave at 8am. It got delayed by 2 hours. I went up to the front to ask them if I could get on the earlier flight or what I could do because I had a connecting flight and then another one after that all the way to South Africa. They did not assist me at all and told me that I’ll get there before my flight leaves. I missed my connecting flight due to this delay and then they still made me pay to return back to Shreveport as the next flight is only a few days from now. Honestly the most shocking airline and service I’ve had.   Its sunny skies at every location but I’m on day 2 of cancellations and delays without making it to the destination. It’s just them having a diminished fleet from covid and trying to fulfill increased demand without making it obvious they can’t hold up like they used to.   It’s always something with American. Flight at 8:15 of course has delays to check engines and oil. Meanwhile the plane has been here for hours. Always a pathetic showing and no one to blame but myself for continuing to fly with this airline. I can’t remember the last smooth flight I had with American. Painfully anxious flights and always end up sprinting through an airport.   I had nothing but an exceptionally positive experience. I am not sure whether the airline is much better with their long haul flights versus domestic flights (where most of the complaints seem to be about) or whether I just got lucky. The flight was on-time (actually pushed back a few minutes early). The check in experience was very good at MIA airport. I was able to use Flagship First check in as a Oneworld Emerald and was escorted to the front of the security line by the agent. The AA Flagship lounge is fantastic. As I had arrived at the airport straight from a cruise at 9:30am I had a lot of time to kill until my 4:30pm flight. The lounge is really beautifully presented, light, and food and beverage options were vastly superior to say the BA or Iberia lounges at their home hubs. The cabin/seats. We ended up having one of the forward/rearward configured aircraft and I was a little hesitant about whether i\\'d like this set up but the seats were great and the cabin was stylish and refined. The service onboard was wonderful! All the crew were very friendly, helpful and genuine. The flight time was only 7.5hrs and I loved how the crew managed to finish a full dinner service in an hour and ten minutes while still being polite and not cutting corners. Would completely recommend.   American Airlines is the absolute worse airline ever. I had trouble with Delta in the 1990\\'s but American is worse than Delta was. American cancelled our flight moments before we got to the airport without an explanation. Now my wife and I are sitting in the airport for 5 hours waiting for the next plane that we are on standby. Next time we fly it will be with United or Frontier.   Had a flight from Las Vegas, that was delayed two times. After the second delay, my connecting flight was missed. After getting to Phoenix an hour plus after the time I was supposed to be there. We stood in line for customer service to get updated flight and after standing in line for an hour and a half, we were told that window was closing and we had to walk to the other side of the airport. We then waited about another 45 minutes trying to get flights and ultimately had to get a room voucher and a taxi voucher. However if you are given the voucher for the Hotel San Carlos depending on the time, save yourself a trip and find somewhere else. This particular hotel is ancient. It’s definitely not even worth the voucher. Checked in and immediately we decided to get out of there even though it was 2 am. We knew we would not be able to stay there. Unfortunately I would say try flights from somewhere other than American Airlines. Save yourself some time and even with all of that some of the staff had a nerve to be rude. Like we had a choice in the flight being delayed.   I traveled with my family, 3 of us. We could have easily sat in one row together. Yet, instead of keeping our family together to avoid contamination with others, we were all seated separately with others. On top of the fact there is absolutely no social distancing, we are being further exposed to the virus and its deadly consequences by sitting with strangers. This is an ongoing issue as I heard others in the aircraft complaining about the same thing. We travel American all the time and now we feel very unsafe. To me and my family this doesn\\'t make sense, but to the airline, I\\'m assuming it makes plenty \"cents\" as we are being charged outrageous prices to choose to sit with our loved ones.   Chicago to Los Angeles. Generally the inflight service they provide is pretty great. Friendly flight attendants, good meals, etc. The problems crop up before or after the flight. Starting with the ticket purchase process - at some point I was able to choose the seat when purchasing even the cheapest tickets, but that\\'s not the case anymore. Now you can pay more upfront to get the seat option, pay for an \"upgrade\" while checking in, or just get assigned a random seat after check in.  I\\'ve almost exclusively flown American since moving to the US, and one thing that happens pretty consistently is baggage space. When boarding almost every flight, they will announce the overhead bins are full so passengers (in the last few groups) are either \"forced\" to check-in their carryons or use bins from 5 rows behind their seat, thus blocking the (ridiculously narrow) path and making the boarding process even more chaotic than it already is. And lastly, the reason I even took the effort to write this, customer support (or lack of). If you ever need to call AA for anything, be prepared to speak Robot in order to navigate its futuristic AI conversation engine. And it may seem like it\\'s meant to keep you from speaking to an actual human, but at least it accepts voice input, and what more can I ask from my airline of choice? I don\\'t really know if any of this applies to other airlines as well, but it feels like the service they provide is getting progressively worse! They take advantage of the fact that we don\\'t have many options when it comes to flying (none, really), so they just keep pushing us around with 0 accountability.  This was ridiculous and audacious. This was our first time with American and also our last. We flew from Munich via Charlotte to Charleston, South Carolina. On our flight from CLT to CHS, we were already about one and a half hours delayed, apparently due to an aircraft change. That in itself wasn’t nice, but if would’ve been somewhat acceptable. The real problems started on our return flight back to Munich, as we left CHS with a delay of over 2 hours. Since AAs schedule is ridiculously tight, the delay caused us (and many other passengers with connecting flights) to miss our connections. We missed our flight by a grand total of 5 minutes, because they couldn’t hold the aircraft an additional five minutes (especially since we weren’t the only ones running to catch that specific flight). We were then sent to a service desk to arrange a re-booking and initially hoped to be re-booked onto a later flight with Lufthansa or British Airways (which is a Oneworld member so re-booking would’ve been logical), but the agent didn’t even bother to check if they had any seats available and just told us we’d have to wait 24 hours for the next flight with AA since they only re-book passengers to another airline if they can’t get you to your destination within 24 hours. While they did give us two hotel rooms for the night, they only provided one food voucher (12$ per person, which was absolutely ridiculous. In the end, I missed parts of my university exams and my father missed an important business meeting, both of which we would’ve been able to attend had we been re-booked to British Airways. Oh and while I’m at it: don’t expect to get your luggage before departing for the hotel. We asked to retrieve it and were told, we’d have to wait between 2-8 hours to get it delivered (keep in mind, it was 7pm), which meant we were stuck in the hotel (which thankfully provided some amenities) with just our carry-ons. It became apparent there is no communication between and knowledge of other departments with AA staff since the re-booking agent told us we‘d get our bags right away, while the guys at the baggage claim said the above. The baggage guys (also from AA) even said there was no communication between departments and certainly no mutual help. This experience and the treatment we received was quite literally the worst we’ve ever had with any airline (and we are frequent fliers), be it a US or other airline. Just something I‘d like to add as well: when we arrived at the hotel, we were told that this treatment is quite common with AA and that, on average, they accommodate many AA passengers daily due to missed or cancelled connections. Though I feel obliged to point out that the flights and flight crews were actually quite good (good food, clean aircraft, friendly crew), but the management, as mentioned, is just horrible. If you have a booking with AA, do yourself a favor and find a different airline, that way you‘ll save yourself a lot of grief and anger.    I have never seen so many people left hanging on standby. We were pushed on standby for 3 flights, no sleep, no suit case, same clothes for 1.5 days. The issue of people trying to find gate changes was unreal. We had 2 gate changes on the 3 standbys. Not to mention the gate agents, we had one in Miami named Alex he was very helpful otherwise no one. As for the customer service in the airport all were very rude. It is all about them not the customer. I have to say these poor agents put up with what the executives plan, you executives make their jobs unbearable. Not sure how anyone can work there under all these circumstances. 2 hour delay with a plane in Bahamas, 40 minutes on the tarmac in Miami and of course over a mile long line in customs due to Americans number of standby flights. by this time we missed our 9 PM flight and again stood in line at American from 8:30 until 12:30 PM to be put on standby at 6 AM the next morning to Charlotte. We made the 6 AM flight then on stand by for three times there. no sleep, no suit case, same clothes. Finally we got on a 3:30 flight to Minneapolis. As we were on my sister in law went to her seat and then was hauled back to the door to get off. Someone was in her seat. Her husband had enough he said 2 people were listed after us on standby and we were told they go by the list so the ones behind us on here need to get off. They ended up taking off the lady who seat in her seat which did not have a ticket just a standby stub. We will never use American again, and I would suggest to anyone out there fly Delta at least they treat you nice and get you back on a flight!  We arrived at Miami about 1/2 hour early and sat there waiting to un board for over 30 minutes. Then when I finally got off the plane to make my connection, it’s delayed 30 mins. We were supposed to start boarding at 9PM and it’s now 13 minutes after and they just started boarding. I usually take Copa or Avianca but during COVID it was hard to get customer service. So, I figured I’d go with American. Wrong move. I have not experienced any delays with Copa or Avianca. I gave you a chance and you blew American Airlines.   Flight from New Orleans to Dallas was delayed, when we finally got to the gate to board our connecting flight they had given away our seats because we were not there within 15 minutes of taking off, because the flight was delayed. Customer service sucks, not accommodating then put us on stand by for the next flight while our original flight was still sitting there delayed. Ridiculous, I understand why they have 3 stars now.  Dallas to New York JFK. We are still in Dallas waiting for a plane and have changed gates. It will be a very long night. After waiting 3 hours and the plane we are supposed to take still isn’t even here.   With the COVID-19 pandemic air travel has changed dramatically. Not necessarily for the better. Citing public safety health concerns, food and beverage service has all but been eliminated. Additionally, in flight reading materials are gone from the seat pockets, and flight attendants remain absent throughout the flight. Needless to say the pleasure and comfort of air travel has been severely impacted. Not so with American Airlines. Our flight # 2604 from Charlotte North Carolina to Los Angeles on October 1, 2020 was one of the most enjoyable and memorable flights in my 50+ years of air travel mainly due to American Airlines employee Steve Henderson. His warm smile, upbeat personality, attentiveness, and concern for all passengers was exceptional. Over and above. Thank you Steve and American Airlines for the miles of smiles.  Tampa to Memphis. American lacks proper etiquette in all respects, their flight attendants and customer service staff are horrid. They treat paying customers like the scum on the bottom of their shoe! First flight of the day I missed and my seat was bumped to economy. I had no issue with this because that’s what they had to offer and was left, but when I attempted to reach American Airlines to get the difference refunded to me they refused. The customer service rep was rude and gave no reason as to why the amount could not be refunded to me. Instead he refused and hung up the line. Not only did I not get my money back, on the second flight a flight attendant decided to single me out for wearing headphones during the safety run down. I did not realize that was taking place because we just boarded the flight. I got off the phone and simply told the attendant I was sorry and unaware and she told me to not to talk back to her and that I was interrupting. TO NOT TALK BACK TO HER!? I found that to be outrageous considering I wasn’t “TALKING BACK TO HER” and in fact being the complete opposite. The fact that this flight attendant thought it was okay to talk to me as if I were her child left me almost speechless until I realized the people sitting right next to me were playing games on their iPad and decided to say something because I was evidently singled out!! I paid over $600 flying with American just to be treated with disrespect. I will never fly with them again. I will always fly with Delta! Delta has always had the best customer service and best flight experiences I could ever ask for. American could learn a lot from them.   It was bad enough when my original outgoing flight was canceled and changed to 10 hour later arrival then planned, but the returning flight was canceled and rescheduled 4 times in 2 hours and they waited to cancel the rest of my connections after  I was boarded on a rescheduled 3 stop flight! I could have stayed with my sister until the next day. My best friend and travel companion had her flights canceled until the following morning, so she had to book a hotel for the night. Never again American Airlines.   American Airlines took me from Philadelphia to Charlotte safe and on time. Our flight left on time and arrived 30 minutes ahead of schedule, the crew was efficient during service, WIFI on board worked great, and it was free with my cell phone provider. I’ve recently flown on a 737 Max 8 and I feel the A321 was a bit more roomier. Overall nothing negative to say. Good job AA!  This airline is poor when it comes to accountability for making people miss their flights I wouldn\\'t ever suggest American for business trips or anything that you have a specific time to be there. We had to sit for 45 minutes for some unknown reason before we were able to get off which caused several people to miss their flights. I missed my flight and the only available flight for my destination is the following day in the evening so now I\\'ve lost an important client because the gates were closed and I wasn\\'t allowed to board. American need to have all their employees communicate so things like this won\\'t happen.   Don\\'t bother to reach out to customer service if you would like an issue resolved. They will continue to send you generalized responses about nothing being able to be done, while telling you how much they \"value you as a customer\" and hope you will return in the future. Consistently changing flights and overbooking in an effort to please shareholders over customers. As someone who books travel for upper level management and our board of directors I will, without a doubt, be securing flights through another carrier for all future meetings/trips. Booking in advance is often required if you would like a reasonable price on flights and would like to secure your desired time in addition to knowing you can book rental cars and hotel stay. I check all three of these prior to booking so I can be sure all are available and I am receiving the best deal possible. Some folks are very particular about nonstop flights. I recently planned a trip around a nonstop flight. Both my outbound and inbound flights were changed to add stops. A refund was offered; however, I had already made travel plans to go along with my flight dates and times weeks prior. Additionally, there were no other non-stop flights on my date. When inquiring about the cause to the change, AA told me they were \"unable to give specifics\" translating to  it\\'s on us, but we do not take accountability. As someone diagnosed and medicated for anxiety, not having to make a stop and traverse an airport (especially a larger airport like DFW) in a 40 minute window is important to me, as is consistency. This, again, remains extremely disappointing, I am not pleased with the overall customer service and do not feel any resolution was reached.   Absolute worst airline to fly! Staff including pilot was rude. I will never book another flight on American Airlines. The customer service and the corporate offices are the worst.   The worst customer service. Plane late. Missed our connector. No sorry just oh well wait another 2 hours, and then rebooted us in the aisle although we paid for window seats. If you don\\'t have apple no entertainment. And no selection on drinks.   After my flight was cancelled in Norfolk Virginia because the flight crew was stuck at the LaGuardia airport on May 16, 2022, I thought the worst was over. No hotel accomodations given, no cares given, just rebook your flight for no additional fees as if it were my fault. New flight scheduled for May 18th and the flight has been delayed due to technical issues. We\\'ve been stuck on this airplane for 2 hours with no update as to when we will depart. My relationship with American Airlines is over. The unprofessional is unbelievable.  On Jan 21 we flew from Philadelphia PA to Sarasota FL, and upon arrival discovered that my suitcase was severely damaged - the zipper had been ripped and the lock removed. When I went to the Baggage Office at Sarasota, he offered to send it out for repair, which wouldn\\'t have been any good; then offered me another suitcase which was too small. I sent in all the relevant information, including pictures of the damaged suitcase and the new suitcase and lock that I bought. AA promised to refund my purchase price and did so in about 10 days. I am completely satisfied. I should also add that my daughter, finding herself in a seat next to an extremely large man, requested and was given a seat change with no problem.   For my husbands 65th I booked an Alaska cruise in Seattle, We live in Naples Fl. Everything went beautifully until our route home. I booked first class tickets for the entire journey. I did this as we are older and I have MS. Sitting in the rear seats for hours at a time is quite painful. Upon boarding our last flight, we were pulled out of the line and told that they had over sold the first class compartment. My husband and I had less miles then the new comer who wanted first class, we were told to move to the back of the plane. We were offered 2-$300 vouchers for two first class tickets. $600 dollars for 2 first class tickets! And the truth is, why would I trust flying with you again if you can just take my money and my seat and send me to the back? The flight attendant in first class came back to us and apologized and said that if there was any food left in First class - she would bring it back-she never showed. The attendant that was in our area, told us \"its just a few hours\" and rolled his eyes! I deliberately choose first class when I fly so as to be comfortable as my MS makes walking difficult, the more cramped I am in a small place the harder it is to get up and move. So first class allows me space and to get off first and not hold others up. In all fairness I am not using a cane at this time as I have my husbands arm, so they wouldn\\'t have known outside of a slow gate and age that there was an issue. I have never been treated so disdainfully in my life, side note, the flight was not even close to being sold out   Phoenix to Minneapolis. Will never fly American Airlines again. I called a few times before booking to make sure they do social distancing and I was told yes and not to worry. I booked my flight to only find out that the flight is completely full and absolutely zero social distancing. I complained so they gave me a different seat that’s supposedly had an empty middle seat next to again another lie the row was full. I don’t understand why not just tell me the truth so I wouldn’t book with them. I felt so unsafe and uncomfortable the entire time. Absolutely ridiculous and will never fly with them again. And customer service sucked zero help and rude as hell.   We boarded our flight 549 at 12:30pm on May 4, 2023. I am writing this review as we are still sitting on the plane on the ground at the Charlotte airport at 2:48pm. I am pregnant and over heating. This is the first and last time I will be flying this airline. It took two hours for us to even be offered water.  Washington DC to Detroit. American Airlines has the worst customer service. I traveled from Washington DC to Detroit on 28JUN2022. I had two checked in bags. I received one and one got delayed. Filed lost baggage claim and was promised to receive baggage in next two days. Nothing showed up. Made a trip to Detroit Metro airport and they said we still have your baggage in DC. We will make sure it is on the next flight. Three days later later not info. no calls, no email. So went back to Detroit Metro airport and first they said it is in DC still. Then the claim manager call DC airport and now DC rep said it no more in DC and said don\\'t know where is and gave us 877 367 7553 number to call CBRO Dallas. I have been trying to reach them but no Luck. I am not sure what should I do.   Philadelphia to Tampa. The main reason for this review is the fact that items were taken from my luggage on 07/01. A complaint was filed within 3 hours of landing. I was contacted by Melanie from the baggage resolution office 2 days later. She stated that American Airlines has a limit of liability for stolen items. Claims need to be reported within 24 hours and customer relations didn\\'t receive the complaint until 07/03. Really? So American Airlines didn\\'t check their email until two days later and choose to ignore the claim. Will never fly with them again! Good luck when your personal belongings are stolen.   We are a family of 6 so 6 seats and at the boarding area they have told us the airplane cabins are full and there is not enough room for our 3 carry-ons! And they have to check them in to our destination airport which is an international one (we will get there after 22 hours) and I have told them that I have very important stuff and kids diapers and clothes and they still said no and we will have to reschedule if we don’t listen to them!! When I got inside the plane I saw some people keeping there backpacks inside the cabins which takes place. At least they could have asked them to put them underneath their seats to allow some room for the carrions. I’m so disappointed and mad. We have history also of luggage damage and breaking my sons PS. I will think twice before booking one of their flights next time.   Like most of the other reviews mine also deals with flight changes, delays, and missed connections. From LAX to PHX the flight went as planned but once in PHX they said we missed connecting flight. We did not miss any flight through fault of our own. The previous day that sent an email that ask to change flights and be compensated. I refused as I had a planned schedule. Since I refused to delay voluntarily I think they just booted me to the later flight. In PHX we were switched to three different gates and two different flights. Our plan included an 5 hour drive from our destination airport, ABQ , to Amarillo which was close to home. We had left our vehicle in ABQ and were suppose to pick it up around 7 PM for our drive home. We ended up in ABQ at almost midnight and we were dead tired so decided to not make the drive and just spend the night. I am currently seeking compensation for the room and expensive meals we had to eat at the airport. I doubt that I will ever choose AA again. I was also not happy with the airplane A320 and the way they seated passengers. We were four, two adults and two teens, The adults were seated 5 rows back from the teens which might not have been so bad if the plane were full but there were empty rows, not seats, rows behind our teens. We also noted three grown men had to share a row when there were plenty of empty seats that they should have been seated in for better comfort.   They closed the cabin door and didn’t take off till an hour later. They directed me to another flight and they also didn’t take off till an hour later. They could have easily let me get on the first flight. I had to wait three hours for the second flight to take off. Horrible.   American Airlines lost my stroller/carseat on our way to Disneyworld, in July 2021, they did not have a loaner stroller small enough for my six week old infant. I was forced to rent an infant stroller from the parks out of pocket. When my stroller/carseat we’re finally found and brought to us the brand new car seat had multiple tears in the fabric, the stroller was stained with grease. I was annoyed that a $400 travel system that had only been used twice was trashed but I was grateful to no longer have to pay for rentals. On our way back home to Palm Springs my stroller was destroyed. It was returned to me with multiple pieces missing from the canopy and the bassinet/seat of the stroller, the wheels were also broken. I immediately contacted customer service and I was told that I needed to reach out to the stroller manufacturer to see if they were able to send me replacement pieces, the pieces needed were out of stock until April 2022. I informed American Airlines of this fact, they told me I needed a letter starting that because replacement pieces weren’t available that I needed a replacement stroller. After reaching out to the manufacturer for several months I was finally given the necessary letter in November 2021. I forwarded the letter to American Airlines customer service, I did not hear back from them until mid February 2022. They informed me that I didn’t get the letter within 30 days of the date I filed the claim so they would be denying my claim to replace the stroller they soiled and broke. Not only did I go back and forth between both companies for months and had to wait several months for replies from each company due to everyone being understaffed but I was shocked that I was not reimbursed for the rental strollers nor was my $400 travel system replaced by American Airlines. I will never fly with them again and I don’t suggest you trust them with you baby stuff, the fact that hazardous airplane grease was all over my baby’s was disgusting but they also lost several pieces of the stroller and took no accountability.   My family and I came from a long 12 hour long flight from overseas, which was also American Airlines (went smoothly) and when we landed in Dallas it was supposed to be a short 2 hour layover before heading to Austin. Turns out the flight kept getting delayed and delayed over and over again whether it was technical issues or due to not having a pilot to operate the plane. Originally was going to depart at 6:00 pm, was now delayed to 11:50 pm. Unbelievable. Service was mediocre at best, but overall extremely chaotic and unorganized and it would have been better to have put my money in a more competent airline. We have stayed at the airport for over 7+ hours. Please put your money in a better airline, just because it’s cheap doesn’t necessarily mean it’s worth it.   When preparing myself for arrival the flight attendant told me my seat back needed to go up. I informed her that I had pressed the button a few times and the seat back wasn’t moving. Then she watched as I pressed it again, still with no movement. She did nothing to help me but give me the “death glare,” as my surrounding seat group named it. Then the couple sitting behind me pushed the back of my chair up but it still wasn’t moving. Still no help from the flight attendant, just that rude annoyed face. Finally the seat went up, she just walked away annoyed. If you don’t like helping people then don’t work in a customer service industry. It is so unpleasant to be treated poorly, when you are actively working to help the situation.   Flying out to Athens on a 9.5 hour trip on a Boeing 787-8. My 1 star review is because of how extremely tight American Airlines have gotten with the Economy Class. First there was no more room overhead for our bags and the foot space was horribly tight with no space for a bag! We just came a month earlier on a Lufthansa flight to Bucharest and they had a decent amount of space on there Economy Flights. I would not recommend AA for such a long flight. I would go with another airline that cares about people, not just how much money they can make from herding as many people as possible on a plane!  Having recently had a great experience (see my review below) I unfortunately had a mediocre one on this trip. Same aircraft, same great seat but on this 3 hour flight extremely bad service. The crew was not unfriendly but totally did the minimum after the initial drink and (cold) meal service I was never checked on again. More importantly there was no pre landing safety check at all. That is serious and unforgivable. To top it off the flight came into the Tom Bradley Terminal and there was no direction about the 25 minute walk to baggage claim in Terminal 4. After the long walk there was still a long wait for the luggage delivery. I guess my last flight was a fluke. Too bad.   Boston to Phoenix via Sacramento. Absolutely terrible. Poor planning and execution by American Airlines. We waited for food to be loaded onto the plane. Took over an hour. Pilot said someone dropped the ball. Sure did.   Arrived at DFW on time and sat at the gate for 20 minutes because they didn\\'t have anyone to operate the jet bridge. 2nd leg to Tucson was delayed by 90 minutes because they didn\\'t have enough flight attendants. A really shoddy operation.  I paid extra to get into priority 4 so I wouldn\\'t have to check my carry on bag. I was still forced to, being told there would not be room on the plane. I got to the plane, guess what, plenty of room for my bag I no longer have possession of. If I wanted to check my bag, I would! I have laptops and personal belongings in this bag, I do not want it being thrown around. Not to mention, the stupid app won\\'t let you check in. You have to be at the airport to check in. Stupid. I fly with Southwest, Delta, and others, this is the absolute worst service ever.   I have had so many bad experiences with American Airlines and can’t seem to ever fly with them without some sort of delay or missing bag, that I figured it was time I wrote a review. Hopefully whoever runs this care enough about their company to do something about it. This airline is atrocious.   Absolutely worst over-the-phone customer service. After being on hold of 1.5 hours, I was greeted by a lady who put me on hold to check out some flights I was curious about. After being on hold, someone took me off hold, and I heard laughing in the background without anyone answering the phone. Eventually they hung up the phone and the 2 hours while on hold was a waste. Now   I had initially planned on a 5 1/2 hour layover on a connecting flight from Indianapolis to Maui. Upon arrival in Phoenix I approached an American Airlines customer service rep and asked what the chances were of getting on an earlier flight. He was extremely accommodating and told me he would get my whole family of four on flight within an hour, and with no upcharge costs. He even told us he was originally from that area and gave us some great suggestions on places to visit. His name is Tevi.   I go into this review understanding this has been a doozy of a year for the industry but never in my life have I experienced this. A girl friend and I were able to get a last minute ticket to Florida from Phoenix. We had a connecting flight in Houston (getting in at 11.30pm on Thursday) with our final flight to Miami the next morning, Friday, at 7.20am. We get into an extremely empty airport and look up at the board to check our morning flight to find it cancelled, they sent us an email that this connecting flight was cancelled 8.02 while we were already in the air. We find someone still working and ask about another flight, he was so dismissive. He literally waved us away while telling us that our app would have more options than his computer and said this while walking away into a terminal door. We had no idea if he was coming back. When he did, someone else was there and the original guy finally took interest in helping us. We knew this wasn’t his fault but we are two young moms away from our families for the first time now stranded in a different state. He said he could offer a hotel but that it “wouldn’t be the nicest”, even though there was a hotel in the airport but he said he had no access to it, oh and that the transport ended at midnight so we’d have to hurry (literally would give us only 10min to get out of the entire airport). He then offered to put us on standby for a flight the following morning, Friday, at 5am and then booked us a flight at 6pm in case we couldn’t get on the morning flight (missing half our trip but at this point something was better than nothing). After an extremely glamorous stay in the empty terminal we woke the next morning and checked our app only to see that he had booked us for 6pm the following day, Saturday. There was at least 15 other people on standby for the flight so we didn’t get on, effectively ending our attempts to get to Miami. The entire time they said it was cancelled because of a domino affect caused by weather, there was multiple people from our group already there sending us videos of clear skies. Three other people from three different locations were all able to get to Miami just fine and to add salt to the wound, exactly 10min after our original cancelled flight, another airline to Miami left right on time from the same terminal. When we finally got on a plane back home (after spending 15 hours in the airport), I was getting leaked on by, what I assume, a weird condensation build up in the window when we were descending, it wasn’t just a drip, it was a lot. So when we landed I told the stewardess, just to let them know in case something was wrong and she said “well do you want a napkin or something? There’s nothing I can do about it” I’m an overly polite person and I just can’t get over how rudely we were treated, constantly. We were told to call for refunds once we were officially home and when we finally did, I did talk to an extremely nice gentleman but was told that we may just get a ticket voucher, even though we also paid an additional insurance fee. We are still waiting to hear back (via phone or email we were told) almost two weeks later and my friend checked online to see the status and it was denied but when you click to go further into the site, it still shows a weird pending but of only $125, the ticket was $638. Give us our money back.  Bad experience: we upgraded to get better seats, better food, and help my anxiety but in the end our seat was broken and we couldn’t use our headphone. 12 hour flight with no entertainment it was a nightmare. Plus: they lost my partner’s luggage, we are already 8 days here and it is impossible to get in touch with anyone! Nobody is helping, phone not answering, and the form to fill is impossible! This is by far the worst experience flying ever!   American Airlines can\\'t and nor will they even try for their customers. Again getting a run around from this poor performing organization who daily show they do not care about us. Even as a member of their rewards club and Platinum Elite Card holder, they just take your money, throw you around wherever they want, pick and choose who is grounded even when they make the schedule, and then make monetary offers then don\\'t follow through? Not to mention the Relations department taking over 2 weeks to not resolve an issue that should have been resolved in 24 hours. This is just an embarrassing operation at this point. I don\\'t know if we should use tax money to bail out companies like this that would never left a finger to help any of us? Time for me to have our company take a look at the other airlines out there that may actually want our business and at least act like we are valued.   Everyone is totally incompetent. They had no crew and blamed it on weather that hit earlier. We had a plane and clear sky, but our crew was timed out and no one had thought to obtain a different crew until our plane landed. I have run logistics and would have been fired if I ran it this way. Next problem is customer service, they have none. They were inconveniencing the passengers to make their job easier by continuing to move the line to another location. One person just shut his line down. That person should be fired. But since they are union, nothing will ever happen. No other industry can treat its clients/customers like they are trash and still operate. We should not allow that here either. They also had 2 planes heading to the same place but would not let us on it. The other plane was half full. So Ultimately due to incompetent staff and bs policies, many people ended up on the floor. Will never give them any more money  Newark to Houston via Charlotte. It was a comfortable flight with the ability to take a carry on for free. Quite a nice way to get to Houston from New York. We got a snack while on board. We had to wear masks.   A frustrating trip all around. Late flights causing stressful connections, overbooked flights, etc. Very stressful. The dog situation on 2 of our four planes was very uncomfortable. Our flight from Atlanta to Toronto had a dog on it that barked the entire flight. It was awful. Our flight from Toronto to Washington on our way home had a large dog on a passengers lap, almost directly behind our Business class seats, that was close enough and large enough that it caused my wife (who has a fear of dogs) to be very uncomfortable. We were under the impression that pet dogs on flights had to be in carriers? We will not be recommending AA at all.   Missed flight by a couple of seconds. Won’t let us on. Rebooking line is about 8 groups of people but took 2 hours, yes 2 hours. Instead of a 6 hour flight now we have to waste 16 more hours flying to random places. Ok, at least the agent did help us rebook. Told us gate d14, boarding now. We went from the rebooking booth with is next to gate d37 to d14, when we arrived there were only a couple of people there, waiting for the same flight since an hour ago, and there is no agent around to be seen or signs or broadcasts. I checked the flight info board two gates away, it said d43 for our flight instead. So we had to run all the way back the direction we came from and almost missed the flight again. Planes are 737max, the awesome ones that have no screen. Since they have no screen the stewardess had to demo the safety instructions. I cannot recollect when I\\'ve seen that last. On our previous leg, we and a lot of other people were told that the overhead bins were full so we need to check in our bags. After the gate check in madness, when we boarded we noted a lot of empty spaces, so much so that on take off and landing you hear luggage moving to the front and back in the compartments due to the empty spaces. And of course, our brand new carry on luggage was damaged and beat up. Overall an extremely poorly managed airline. If not for the name American I would expect it to be out of business like yesterday.   Providence to Tucson via Chicago. American Airlines is the most unorganized and unprofessional carrier. Poor planning and customer service, impossible to change flights, flights are delayed. They\\'re an absolute joke, I\\'ll never fly with them again. Spend the extra $20 and go with a different airline, it\\'ll save you so many headaches   Me and my husband boarded a flight from LaGuardia to DFW and had a layover in DFW to then board a flight to HOU. First off our first flight was delayed for seemingly no reason by 3 hours. So we then missed our connecting flight. They hooked us up on another flight to George bush where we sat in the plane for 45 mins before we were informed it was cancelled due to weather. We proceeded to sit in the plane for another hour and a half with them refusing to let us off. Finally after 2 hours they let the flight out and the guy at the gate thought we just flew in from Omaha?? We then proceeded to sit in the longest customer service line ever in which they told us the next flight they could get us on was 4 pm the next day. Which they had already boarded our checked luggage on without our knowledge. Whether I wanted to take the flight or not never mind I was forced to check it because our first flight over head bins were too full. Now our luggage is flying into Houston at 4 pm and me and my husband will not be there to pick it up. I have never had issues with any other airline like this. Single-handedly one of the worst days of my life due to incompetent people who don’t care about they’re customers at all. I cannot believe the way American Airlines handled this. I’m giving you this warning save yourself a lot of pain and never fly with them.   \\r\\nChaotic. Flight was first delayed an hour then the plane had broken down so we had to move planes and after being sat on the plane there was another 4 hour delay. This is very unprofessional and unorganized. This airline is terrible please never book a ticket to this airline.   American Airlines canceled my Flight going to RSW from DCA and did not do anything to help me get another flight in the matter of time that I needed for an event that was starting the day after. When I told them I needed the next flight they were so unaccommodating and rude towards my request. They made me stand in a long customer service line when I clearly had no time for that. When I fly United my needs are met right away and at a desirable request, American airlines could literally care less about me and used rude tone with me where I felt personally attacked for my actions of stress and felt belittled. I also am one of American Airlines Advantage members as is my entire family and the way I was treated today is a definite call to retract my membership. I will not accept this every, I am now missing my best friends wedding and this will not ever happen to me again.   American Airlines single-handedly ruined my vacation. On the way home from an international flight they had the audacity to cancel my flight from Miami to St. Louis. They then re-booked us for the following day to fly to Boston and then finally to St. Louis. (with a 40-minute layover). But wait it gets better. After staying a night in Miami, we went to the airport to find out the flight to Boston had been delayed an hour. The customer service reassured us they would hold the plane, so we boarded and waited because of the weather. When we arrived in Boston we ran to our new gate and it said the flight had closed, meaning they did not wait for us. The best part was they were just sitting there because of the weather but still would not let us on.   I flew to Spartanburg on short notice to be with my father in law who was hospitalized with Leukemia. I had to cancel my return flight and was emailed that I had a flight credit that I could access through AA.com. (no mention that I had to call reservations). I later rebooked my return flight online only to find out I could not access the trip credit. I had literally thirty minutes to book the flight and leave for the airport so I just paid for the flight. I call AA today to access my flight credit. The person on the phone was short, snippy, implied I was stupid for not knowing I needed to call. She had no interest in a discussion about their misleading information. She said \"you will just have to use that credit on a future flight\". I told her that would be difficult because I plan to become a loyal Delta Frequent Flyer moving forward. As a side note, I am a consultant and will be going back on the road with weekly flights moving forward in April. So shortsighted.   Never fly with them, they canceled our flight and then delayed our next day flight. You can’t even talk to go a person about compensation, you can only talk via email. They only have a $12 voucher to use at the airport which they expect you to last the whole day.   I purchased my own $3000 battery powered wheelchair so I don’t have to use the airlines (& other places) wheelchairs. My chair is FAA approved but yet I was detained for multiple hours, left in cue or the gangway while they made mechanical repairs to the plane. I had no access to food, water or a bathroom. I was forced out of my chair because they said my battery was not safe to fly. I was told I might not be allowed to board if I did not remove the battery from my chair. When I responded that I’ve never had to remove it (hence, the fact that it’s affixed to the frame with screws & the cord is all wrapped around the frame with flex ties), that I was not physically capable of removing along with the lack of knowledge to comply with their request. A man said “if you keep refusing to cooperate, we are going to deny you boarding”. I was not refusing, I simply was telling the truth & pointing out the obvious. I was never disrespectful to any staff. I am a disabled veteran diagnosed with PTSD/MST & chronic pain from an injury to my knees while serving in support of Desert Storm. I also have allergies & asthma. Asthma that is usually triggered by animals, flowers or pollen in the air. After I was allowed to board, I saw 7 cats & dogs pass by me. My eyes were already burning just from that. So I inquired what my rights were regarding those animals & my allergies because I could tell it was going to be an issue. After 14 days on a ship, all we wanted to do was go home & I had done a miraculous job of orchestrating everything so there would be no hold up anywhere. An AA employee got down face level with me & whispered in my ear that if I kept pursuing the allergy thing & insisting that I might need aid (ie oxygen) if I have an asthma attack from the animals & my rescue inhaler does not do the trick, that they will remove me from the flight. She said I suggest you take another mask from them & put it over your mask, turn your air vent on & or you won’t be flying. AA turned a 9 hour day into 27 hours, rebooked me to be stuck overnight in an airport, taking a whole other day to get to my destination & offered me no accommodation, reimbursement for or even a food voucher. Other people on the flight got vouchers but not me. I checked in with 3 bags & I’m 4 days after check in to the original nightmare flight & I’m still missing a bag with all of our brand new clothes in it.  Can’t get anybody on the phone to tell me where it is or when it might be here.  I do not recommend flying this airline.   I had two connecting flights booked for my trip home. On the first flight, they were asking people to switch to a later flight for monetary compensation, so I offered. They added me to the next flight as a “backup” but ended up not needing me to switch, but they never took me off that new flight. I get on this first flight with no issues, but when I don’t show up for the second one (that shouldn’t have been booked at this point) they flag it as a “no-show” and cancel all upcoming flights on that trip — my second flight home that night AND my two flights back later that week. At this point I had no idea this was happening because my boarding pass was still visible on the app for all my flights. At the second airport, I had my boarding pass in the app readily available, walked up to the gate to scan it, and the gate agent stated that my ticket was cancelled and my seat had already been given to someone else. He claimed that I cancelled it myself in the app, which I 100% did not do and never received an email, text, notification, etc that my ticket was cancelled. Luckily they were able to squeeze me on the last flight of the night, but I was panicking thinking I was gonna have to spend the night in a strange city I’ve never been to before! The gate agents were not very empathetic to my situation. I spoke with the representative on the help line who was unable to help me, so I filed a complaint with corporate who also blamed the entire situation on me and was no help. This entire experience left a very bad taste in my mouth and I would warn anyone booking with this airline!   They don’t know what punctuality is! Issues exiting the first plane, they couldn’t open the door and took a while for the right people to come and fix it. Second plane was delayed. Customer service wasn’t great either. \\xa0 \\xa0I\\'m writing this for my wife. She has been stranded by American for 18 hours now, and counting. Two cancellations, and then delays. The plane she\\'s waiting on now was late leaving Austin, and is delayed about 3 hours so far. We have to decide if she\\'s just going to a hotel, and I have to drive to Dallas to pick her up. We are about to give up on the idea of American getting her out of DFW at all. We haven\\'t even begun to talk to them about a refund, but I can imagine how that\\'s going to go. Terrible company. Never fly with them. They have tortured her. She\\'s been awake at the airport for 18 hours now, and she is overwhelmed with exhaustion. Don\\'t let this happen to you. Don\\'t fly American.   American Airline has got to be the worst airline I have ever flown.  We flew from ATL with a stop through MIA and this was the worst experience ever. Coming back from Cartagena back through MIA was extremely stressful. We had to re-check our bags, wait in another line, and go through TSA again - WHY? We made it to the airport on time, only to wait 1 hour to retrieve our bags (again) to get on our connecting flight. Between TSA and re-checking our bags only to miss our flight due to AA bag recheck rule. I will never go through MIA again or do my best to bypass American Airlines all together. I would not recommend AA to anyone. Just avoid the stress all together.  Cleveland to Philadelphia via San Juan. Worst first time experience, not recommended. Bad attitude from the ladies upfront. They lied and fooled me. I was unaware that they had put me on a standby. My son had just passed away. They didn\\'t make me aware. They told me I would fly on the next flight, they lied. They gave it to someone else even though I had been waiting for so long. I started getting panic attacks and I didn\\'t have any medication with me. I would get to final destination at 3am with no one to pick me up. I was lost for words, I couldn\\'t believe it. I know my family and friends will never cross paths with American Airlines again.   In order to use my paper transportation vouchers I had to book our tickets by phone. It is not possible to use them online. After a lengthy phone call all seemed right and I was told the amount that was to be charged to my credit card. After a few weeks the tickets were finally issued but to my surprise my credit card was charged with a higher amount than agreed. After some research I found out that American Airlines wrongly issued an adult ticket to my 9 year old son. That should have been a child ticket. I contacted American Airlines, explained the situation and expected it to be easily resolved. American Airlines acknowledged a mistake was made, issued the correct ticket but simply refuse to refund the money they wrongly charged to my credit card. Instead a voucher, which is utterly useless to me, was issued. They won\\'t even respond to questions regarding the status of my refund request anymore. It blows my mind how they can overcharge my credit card and simply keep my money. This is by far my worst customer experience with any airline. Only good thing is all flights are operated by BA so I won\\'t have to actually fly American Airlines. I\\'ll avoid American Airlines if possible in the future.   Some things never change! As a weekly Road Warrior for a Fortune 100 company, I decided that American Airlines was the absolute nastiest, most disgusting excuse for an airline that I had ever experienced in well more than 1,000,000 miles traveled. Today, a decade later, I found that they are even worse even though I never thought that was possible. Out of Charlotte (gate D3) I tried to move my flight up by about two hours. I was at the airport in plenty of time, there were plenty of seats available and at the same price. The terribly rude gate agent at D3 would not help at all, even though I had an emergency illness at home with an elder family member. No standby option, nothing! She told me to try online, even though I showed her that the website would not work. I heard her tell another furious passenger that there was a Service Desk nearby (which she never bothered to tell me as I struggled!) The Service Desk turned out to be even worse, simply refusing any assistance at all‼️ How do these rude, incompetent people stay in business? This has gone on for decades and yet nothing has ever changed. I’ll crawl before I ever use this monstrous excuse for an airline again.  We got to the airport in Miami at 8am got breakfast and waited. The airline called up the groups to start boarding on time. We got to our seat and wait 2 hours in our seat in the plane. After waiting for 2 hours the airline staff told us we needed to get off the plane because the airline staff was missing paperwork. Then our flight got delay for 4 hours plus the 2 hours we sat on the plane. This is ridiculous. I\\'m an American Eagle member and I was very shocked that this happened.   I planned to travel to Allentown - connecting in Charlotte. Flight originally scheduled to leave around 10am, but was then delayed to 11:30am due to a smell/maintenance. Once boarding the plane, myself and the full aircraft proceeded to wait for over an hour for crews to load baggage and deliver snacks. While waiting, there was barely any airflow (plus masks) as we sat at the gate in Dallas in the summer heat. I am very disappointed in American Airlines. I 100% understand the delay due to maintenance - my highest priority is safety. But then to be left in the airplane for over an hour for bags and snacks is ridiculous.   I am devastated at how corporations selectively forget that people do not have to be exploited in favor of the bottom line. For the first time since COVID, my family and I are about to travel. This morning, when I went in to check on tomorrow\\'s flight, I found out it was cancelled. There was NO communication from American that there had been a change. In the midst of trying to incorporate this change into our plans, I made the mistake of purchasing seats that weren\\'t needed for our other flights. To be fair, it was my mistake. It appeared that seats had not been chosen for our connecting and return flights (they had been, but I was under the impression this changed suddenly as other aspects of the trip had changed without any communication from the airline) and the only seats that were available were the upgrades. I didn\\'t want or need the upgrades. But it appeared that there were no other options. I realized shortly thereafter that there was confusion and misunderstanding and contacted American immediately. The initial agent was kind and understanding about the confusion. The supervisor was not and refused any possible way of working this out so that both I and the airline would be ok. No refunds. Period. No credit or other efforts to buffer the cost. Period. You screwed up (based on our miscommunication) and you still pay. Period. Sparing a lot of unnecessary details here, at the end of the day, I wasted $300 on a misunderstanding I tried to fix, which certainly impacts me much harder than it does American. This should have been an easy fix on American\\'s part. It stinks to start off what is supposed to be a refreshing time of finally getting to travel with such disappointment.  Gate changes all day. Received all notices until the LAST one. Had to run from A13 to D21 in 10 minutes. Made it just after boarding closed. Agent was able to call the aircraft and got me on my flight home. So, I\\'m an upset, stressed out, sweaty, shaky, out of breath, senior citizen boarding the plane. Flight attendant told me to calm down and breathe. Extremely disappointed in the way this flight was handled ALL DAY! It\\'s downright ridiculous! Please take into consideration what you are doing to your passengers when these changes are made. Thank you.  The airline attendants are awesome they went out of their way to make me feel comfortable after speaking to and knowing that my dad passed away. Both my flights were great. Although the bag handlers on the ground need to be more careful with people\\'s things they broke my bag but that has nothing to do with American Airlines. I have to say their customer service was too notch.   Flying with American Airlines has been an absolute nightmare. I will never again in my life fly with American. The customer service is horrid from the start. Our flights were changed multiple times. I have paid multiple times to pick seats and have never sat in the seats I paid for because American Airlines keeps changing my seats. I had a seat and an extra seat and at one point today I had a seat on one flight with my extra seat on a totally separate flight. They can\\'t seem to figure it out. I want refunded for all those seats I paid for and never sat in!!! Our connecting flights were even changed while we were flying to that airport and we weren\\'t told until we arrived at the airport. Along with that, I needed to use the disabled cart services. The guys running the carts were standing around talking to each other instead of getting me to my gate and they tried to close the doors on me. The lady at the gate told me I should have been faster if I wanted on the flight! While having a disability that makes it hard to walk, she kept telling me to walk faster. She was so disrespectful and rude. They tried not to honor my extra seat on the last flight out to Sacramento from Dallas Fort Worth. So many of our flights have been cancelled and rescheduled with little to no notice to get us onto the flights in time. The staff has been so rude and unhelpful during this entire time of flying to my destination and flying home. When I arrived to Sacramento, I requested a wheelchair because of my physical disabilities and I was told NO by American Airlines flight attendants because I didn\\'t use one in Dallas. I was on the disability cart in Dallas to get to my terminal faster (which the people in my group who walked beat us there because the guys driving the carts were standing around talking as we waited for them to stop socializing so we could get to our gates). So I was denied wheelchair use while having a physical disability by American Airlines. Do not waste your money on these people. Fly with Delta, Southwest or United who seem to have better customer service skills and who will help you and fix their mistakes rather than blaming the customer for the error because American will not own up to their mistakes that they made!  When we first made our reservations I had to call them out on Twitter to get them to own up to their error because they wouldn\\'t combine my extra seat with my original seat and said they could cancel our flights as they please at any moment because of duplicate tickets in my name rather than just fixing their error for it to say it was an extra seat.   I booked a flight with American Airlines (first time) as it offered a good price although the operating airlines were known for their bad service. But we decided to trust American Airlines. Well, after a sudden change of plans, I called the not-so-American airlines to cancel the tickets, and was ready for penalties, etc. ... but they offered me a 12 months credit. Ok, sounds nice, United airlines does it, Air France does it. But here is the trick: the 12 months countdown starts the day of the booking. As if it wasn\\'t enough, each ticket will be credited separately, and only the name on that ticket credited can use the credit.  I will update my review when / If we use the credit they issued to each one of us, for the onboard service quality. Till then, American Airlines should live up to the name or fold.   Although they have slightly more comfortable seats and amenities like the phone charger, none of it is worth it when i have to run from gate to gate because they change the gate 30 minutes before the flight.  I had to run for my flight every single flight. The first time i wasn\\'t prepared to be a track star and I made it to the gate 10 minutes before departure but the gate was closed. There was no one at the gate to help me find a desk for support. I found the desk for support and they mocked me like i was responsible for the last minute gate change.  WIFI was $13 per hour or $17 per flight, no option to purchase a day pass and they had a count down timer they literally gave me 1 hour, despite the plane not having signal for 9 minutes. All these terms and conditions on the website so i doubt i can request a refund but a more practical thing to do would be to either give a person an extra 15 minutes or give a day pass. Especially when you don\\'t offer direct flights, so it\\'s like you automatically charging $26 - 34 per day for bad service.  I lost my headset at DFW, I go to the lost and found, the lady didn\\'t even acknowledge A customer at her desk. (airport had 2 lost and found areas) I finally got her attention, explained I lost my headset, she asked when, I told her this morning she didn\\'t have it OK, i asked if she could call the other lost and found perhaps someone turned it in at E terminal. She said no in the most unapologetic way have me a paper with the website and told me that all she could do. i told her i was aware of the website but the website also had the Terminal listed as a location for LOST AND FOUND.  Also forced me to check my bag, I specifically bring a 1 gallon bag with 20 different travel sized bottles like the airport request because going to claim bag area is time consuming, but they forced me to check my bag. Why offer people the ability to bring one bag one personal item, when you really can\\'t bring one bag and one personal item. \\xa0It is unbelievable  This is my 2nd time to fly from Miami to Tampa. Only 1/2 hr flight but every time it is a 5 hours delay and stay in the aircraft all time. If I can give you minus 5 I would. I have no respect for this airline at all   This is the second time that I\\'ve had to spend the night of the airport. Last time we were here for nearly two days because of American. They put us on a plane and had no AC they left us in there for a couple of hours got us back out made us wait a couple hours. Then put us back on the plane again it kept shutting off and they finally said oh never mind we\\'re canceling the flight fully after torturing us for 5 or 6 hours. It was not weather related. No hotel vouchers no vouchers of any kind. Customer service number just says we\\'re busy and hangs up. It\\'s been another couple of hours in line to talk to somebody. He said there\\'s nothing I can do sorry. Something terrible always happens with this airline. Don\\'t ever use them.  Terrible service. They left the gate unattended before boarding closed and only returned after boarding closed. We missed the flight due to the total incompetence of the staff and their ability to do their job. They will sit and lie to your face and say it was your fault that they were not doing their job. If you like terrible service and being spoken to as if you are nothing more than a dog, fly with American. If you would prefer decent service, go anywhere else besides American. It is consistently bad service no matter where you go throughout the country. They give “American” a terrible name. Take your business somewhere else. I would give 0s for all the reviews if I could.   When American Airlines changed flight numbers, they totally screwed up our ability to check in online. We have called them many many times, all four of us each. The customer service is the worst I have ever seen. When they call back, they have not worked with us, they even pretended like they could not hear us. This company is disgraceful and their SVP of customer service needs to be fired immediately. I would never recommend this airline to anybody.   Worst customer service ever. Just tried to pay for an upgrade to first class. My traveling partner did it using the app with no problem. I logged on and the app could not find my reservation. I used the chatbot. Total disaster. I called customer service and was told to use the app. Then I was transfered to web help. That person said she could not help me. I asked for someone who could and she said that\\'s not how it works and to use the app. When I said this was terrible customer service she said use the app. So if you can fly any other airline please, please do yourself a favor and do.  Denver to Belize. Not very impressed with American Airlines from the boarding process to the very uncomfortable seats. The seat in front of my wife broke on the flight to Belize causing the person in front of her seat to be in her lap the whole flight. The crew did nothing to try and fix it. The TV’s were broken on our row of seats on the way home. Won’t fly American Airlines again! Very disappointed with service and quality of planes!  Booked my trip a couple weeks ago and all seemed great. After a few days I got a notice that my connecting city and time was changed, ok, arriving a few hours later so change my hotel and rental car, no biggie. I leave at 7 am, and at 915pm the night before, I get an email that they cancelled my whole trip and changed my departure arbitrarily to Monday, instead of Sunday as I needed and was set to go .wait what? Here it is at 1:30 am and I am on hold to even talk to someone at AA to get my refund. Luckily I was able to online book with Delta while I wait but had to pay 3 times the original cost due to it literally being last minute. Save yourself the hassle and fly with someone else. Looking at these reviews over the past few days I see a pattern here.   After a flight delay and change from IAH to CLT, the flight from CLT to ROA was delayed multiple times. The announcements stated the flight was delayed due to lack of a crew. After waiting somewhere from 1 to 2 hours for a crew and assurance one is getting ready, they announced the flight was now delayed from the current delayed time, 11:04 pm to 7:15 am the next morning. The passengers where instructed to go to customer service to seek any arrangements needed. When with customer service the group of passengers was told no accommodations would be made for hotels or cars. More or less we where all told we will have to just deal with it. Passengers asked to speak to the manager to question what exactly is going on and why are we not given any kind of relief. The manager, rudely, stated nothing could be done by policy bc the last delay was due to weather not a lack of a crew. It was a blatant lie the passengers knew right away. We can all check the weather reports and detuctive reasoning from the previous announcements made it easy to see through. When the manager began to be questioned she quickly became increasingly rude. Passengers began to film her. The manager then walked away threatening to call security on anyone who filmed her. Passengers began to ask for her name. She would not give it and the AA staff at the desk stated they did not know her name, another obvious lie. The manager finished walking off with saying security can through everyone out if needed.   Flights are never on time and they take no accountability for their mistakes. In January I got stuck in Charlotte for 24 hours. They wouldn\\'t pay for the hotel. And right now, I am sitting on a plane delayed of course. But there is no pilot for this plane. A nice gentleman got on the intercom and informed us that they \"think we have a pilot\" but aren\\'t sure. And will \"update us as soon as he figures out whats going on.\" I\\'m about to miss my connecting flight in Charlotte again because of their incompetence. Worst airline, and one of the worst company\\'s ever. Zero regard for their paying customers, it borders on consumer abuse.  Flew to PVD via DCA. No delay on outbound flight. Flight was very smooth as pilots avoided bad weather over the Appalachians and took a southerly route via ATL before turning north. The result - very little turbulence encountered. On arrival in DCA I had a short connection but made the flight with 10 minutes to spare. The gate agents were aware of incoming flights having minor delays. I love 737-800s back seat device holders that hold both iPhones and iPads. The ICE worked flawlessly on the 737-800. The 2nd leg from DCA-PVD was on a Mitsubishi CRJ 700. The WiFi on this flight did not work as well as on the 737-800. Kudos to American Airlines flight crew. They were polite and friendly. Service is typical (biscotti, snack and soft drinks) of all domestic flights.   Detroit to Dallas. I realize that due to weather in Detroit was bad. We missed our connecting flight. AA made very little effort to help us to make our connecting. We only missed it by 2 min. And we was stuck here in Dallas for 10 hrs. I can’t remember the last time I flew AA. But I will make sure it’s the last.   Does not enforce mask rule, was very uncomfortable with people not wearing or not wearing over their nose, it was only a few on each flight but doesn’t matter. I complained to the attendant while exiting the plane and she asked if I told an attendant of this and I said I tried and she said you should have tried harder. I’m not the mask police. I tried getting an attendants attention a few times without making a scene but was ignored or not noticed. Finally, on one flight I yelled at a man standing over my son not wearing a mask to put his on, why aren’t the attendants banning people like they advertise. I will not fly American Airlines during this pandemic again. And also the flights were packed to make things worse.   Our flight was canceled when we tried to depart Dubuque after 5 hours of waiting because the plane needed maintenance. It wasn’t even canceled because of weather so we lost a whole day of vacation due to their unpreparedness. American Airlines also would not offer a discount or upgraded tickets no matter how much I complained. When we finally boarded the seats were very uncomfortable. Also not a single one of the water fountains worked in Orlando and bottles water is 5$. Ridiculous. And on top of all of this the grounds people are not friendly. You ask them a question and they barley answer acting all annoyed. Worst travel experience of my life.    I wish to give an excellent review to one of your employees who checked us in at bag check in Sarasota Florida. Her name is Michelle. Our experience with checking a bag was exceptional from beginning to end. I was traveling with my 13 year old daughter, and she made her feel at ease with kindness and humor. In fact, I told her in all my years of traveling (I’m in my 60’s), I have never encountered an attendant who was so great in her demeanor as a professional airline employee. I hope this can somehow reach her from your end. In this day with all the trouble in travel, I found this so refreshing and needed to reach out to both her and you.   I was trying to fly from Providence to Los Angeles Leaving at 5:30 p.m. from Providence and without explanation their app said my flight was delayed 2 hours and so my connection was blown but they offered no solutions or alternatives on the app. In a panic I approached a gate agent at a Providence to Philadelphia flight loading The plane at 4:30 p.m. and asked if I could get on that flight and possibly fly to Los Angeles from Philadelphia that evening and the agent actually made that happen at. I want to give him a compliment for pulling that off. Unfortunately the flight from Philadelphia to Los Angeles was greeted with a slow moving thunderstorm on the airfield and we waited 3 hours in line for the storm to clear and the planes to take off only to find out that our flight crew had been timed out since they had flown up from Orlando to Philadelphia earlier that day so we had to return to the gate and D plane. By then it was close to 8:30 p.m. and we were told the up flight was leaving at 9:15 p.m. but the staff had no other information then the app said no it\\'s changed to midnight and the staff had no more information then it changed to 215AM and the staff just stared at us mutely. Some of us migrated over to a customer service window 5 gates away and after some shouting from stressed out travelers and apologies from ill informed staff members they suddenly started issuing hotel vouchers and $12 meal vouchers but the largest number of travelers never made it to that line and I think many slept in the airport till 9:15 a.m. when they had told us the flight with finally rescheduled for the final time period at the hotel the $12 vouchers didn\\'t work and the poor hotel clerks after many attempts and much time spent frustratingly in putting the voucher numbers gave up and took our credit cards for our food. 3 out of 4 $12 vouchers didn\\'t work at the hotel. One lucky traveler got his voucher to work. Apparently American Airlines had rooms available and decided at midnight to give them to the travelers since other flights were taking off the storm had cleared enough but because they couldn\\'t find a replacement pilot crew we were left stranded till the next day so they decided we deserved rooms but it was all very poorly handled.   Los Angeles to Syracuse via Charlotte. There is always an issue when you fly with American Airlines! Since my son’s initial flight at LAX is delayed, he will definitely miss his connecting flight at ORD. Therefore he will most likely miss the important event he was trying to attend in the first place. When my son asked for an alternate flight, he was not even helped at American Airlines customer service; instead he was given a phone number to call and make the new travel arrangements himself. When he called, the service representative told him he would have to wait overnight and take a flight out 24 hours later. These flights that we have previously paid for months in advance, are usually cancelled or postponed, especially on the return flights. It definitely seems like false advertisement when an airline promotes and sells seats on flights for specific dates and times, and then cancel, only so they can cram as many passengers together on one plane as possible. And to make matters worse, my son’s luggage has been loaded on the plane that he cannot even take. We are “told” that he can pick up his luggage when he eventually arrives at his destination, whenever and wherever that is! Airlines such as this one rarely live up to their promises, and they aren’t the least bit concerned in how they greatly inconvenience their passengers. American Airlines really needs to do better by their passengers.  Memphis to Kahului via Dallas. I am so upset with American Airlines and their HORRIBLE a customer service. They do not give any regards to unforeseen emergencies. Do NOT book with this airlines. The agents lie to get you off the phone. I will never fly on this airlines again  Our flight was delayed leaving Atlanta due to \"construction\" which is what we were told. There were multiple AA flights delayed and none of the staff would hold the gates although we were arriving only a few minutes late. We had to stand in line for customer service for over an hour. We were basically told that we would have to take the new flight that was assigned which would have us getting to our destination 10hrs later with 3 stops. When I looked on line they actually had a flight leaving an hour later with no stops. We were not offered that flight nor were we offered to be on standby. When asked if AA would accommodate us with a hotel to leave the next morning with no stops, we were told no although the policy clearly states that you all would do so. When asked about the delay compensation policy, were were told that it did not exist although it is clearly found online. Customer service was terrible. I have been flying with American for many years, including for work. I am highly disappointed that we were not accommodated or compensated in any way for the huge inconvenience.  The service when we first arrived was decent. It was very crowded and an American Airline employee yelled at me and my family. We checked our 5 bags and went through security which went well. The flight went well as well. When we land and go to baggage claim 3 of our 5 bags are missing. We were told we won’t get them until the next day at noon earliest. So now I’m stuck in another country without any of my clothes, or hygiene products.   American Airlines just doesn’t care and has no empathy. If you’re interested to know why, read on, and to give some background I’ve been an AAdvantage member for at least 20 years, many of which I was Platinum so I know what I’m talking about. This past weekend I made a visit to my brother who lives out of state and I flew American.  I purchased my nonstop ticket months ago and shortly before my trip American sent me an email telling me that they had changed my ticket and had added a stopover. Not only is a stopover inconvenient and I had initially paid more for a nonstop flight but they were goofy enough to state in their email that there would be “no additional charge for the change”. I know it’s the pandemic but they could do better (they gave me only 25 minutes for my connection!) A day before my flight they sent me an email saying that they had changed one of the gates to a different concourse. So now not only did I only have 25 mins to make my connection (and everybody knows it can take a while for passengers to exit the plane once parked at the gate, which makes such a short connection even tighter) but also now I was arriving at a faraway concourse and had to run as fast as I could to barely make my flight. When I finally made it to my connecting flight’s gate the overhead bin space was full and so they made me check my tiny carry-on (no fault of my own), and this normally would be fine (I guess?) but with my flight arriving at my final destination a bit after midnight and after a long tiring and stressful day now I had to go stand at the baggage claim forever to wait for my tiny carryon to come out. Had they apologized or shown a tiny bit of empathy I would have understood, but nope, that didn’t happen (instead the gate agents were rude, I know they work long shifts and are stressed so I guess I should not expect at least some courtesy anymore). American Airlines just doesn’t care.  I have no words for American. Every time I have flown with them in the last two years I have had a delay or cancellation and with a toddler usually in tow. They don’t do anything to help they all seem unhappy and it has been such a disappointment. When I flew to Texas with them the same thing happened but we had to sleep in the airport because they just kept rescheduling. On this current flight it’s always waiting for a flight attendant. There\\'s no compensation, no thanks for your patience. It’s ridiculous and I will not be flying them again!   After waiting an hour, our flight was cancelled because there were 3, not 4 flight attendants. I was getting booked on new flights, the gate agents were complaining to each other that now they would have to work late and one said she was not staying late. Very unprofessional. My last 3 times flying American have been beyond subpar. Time to start paying a little extra for Delta. At least I won\\'t have to worry about flight cancellations.   Washington to Los Angeles. American corporate greed at its finest. American Airlines has no customer service and wants to pocket as much money as they can during this pandemic. At the end of the month my foreign exchange student manuel was supposed to go on a trip with the foreign exchange program to Washington DC. We booked a flight through Alaska Airlines to go there and a flight with American Airlines to come back. The trip was canceled obviously and Alaska Airlines was kind enough to let him transfer the $135 ticket to somebody else\\'s name since he will not be able to use it but American Airlines decides to keep the $355 ticket and won\\'t let him transfer it to anybody else. He is going back to Spain today so obviously he cannot use that $355 it expires at the end of the year. I hope we don\\'t bail out companies like this. For years they have been profiting millions if not billions of dollars off of high priced tickets and crammed seating with horrible customer service and during this worldwide pandemic they aren\\'t even willing to make exceptions because it affects their bottom line, making money. We got denied on a refund which I expected, but you would think they would be willing to credit the money and let somebody else use it the way Alaska Airlines did. Shame on companies that are using this time to take advantage of customers.   American Airlines has managed to surpass my expectations as a non-frequent flyer with the manners of a small town farm boy. Not only did they manage to destroy my luggage for a second consecutive return flight home but they also managed to have the rudest, nastiest service to overworked and most likely underfunded staff. Your priorities are very well listed indeed .. but very much not with the people you serve. Tucson/Phoenix airport, you were lovely and the staff was very accommodating. Thank you and I do apologize to group you with the unsavory experiences from years past and multiple suitcases ripped open and thrown into trash-bags on the conveyer belt. But when you\\'re in a monopoly with limited funds (as a traveler) there\\'s not much one can do. So to captain Maria and Hope and the third flight attendant (I forget her name I do apologize) I send my appreciation and I very much wish there were more flight crews like yourselves to where maybe then American could pride themselves on their sayings instead of syphoning their next buck.   Worst airline ever. I only flew with them because I had a free trip because of the inhumane way they treated my mom last year. I booked my flight to Vegas in July for October. When I called the airline in September to make sure everything was good they told me my reservation had been canceled. They couldn\\'t tell me who canceled it or why. They wanted to charge me more for a new flight. That was the 1st thing. We got on the plane in Jacksonville to Philadelphia our flight landed 5 minutes after my connecting flight to Vegas took off without us. When we talked to American Airlines customer service they said that it was not their fault and FAA was to blame. They were not accommodating or apologetic. We were stuck in the Philadelphia Airport for 11 hours with no compensation or concern from American Airlines. When we finally got to Vegas the rental car place- hertz- was closed. The next morning they had canceled my car, charged me a missed rental fee and wanted $760 for another car. Needless to say I am now on vacation without a rental car because of what American Airlines did. American Airlines has the worst service ever.   We planned and paid for our multi-city trip in March 2023. Two months later when we checked American Airlines app, they had changed all our flights and seats. They never contacted us by any method to tell us of these changes. Sadly, that was just the beginning. We spent hours on the phone to get a reasonable facsimile of the flights and seats we had originally booked, although we were put in different boarding \"groups\" even though we booked and paid for seats together in the same rows. We had booked our flights 4 months before the trip and still were always in one of the last groups to board. The days we flew there were just more and more problems: flights delayed over an hour with no explanation, multiple gate changes for several flights (including terminal changes as well), their app would randomly display the wrong boarding pass or boarding gate/terminal, we had to have our bags checked at the counter where we were boarding because there was never enough room in the overhead compartments, except on one flight, after they made us check our bags, we discovered there were at least 3 empty overhead bins as well as bags already in the bins that were clearly oversized, and fortunately we had packed lots of snacks since even on a 4 hour flight over the noon hour, all they offered was pretzels or a cookie...unless of course you wanted to buy some other snacks they offered.   I was treated so poorly yesterday by the manager of American Airlines that I will never be returning as a customer. I frequently fly with my Bichon Frise and I was told he was not allowed to go on the flight. The Manager took pleasure in telling me that. She smiled and laughed while I teared up. I was trying to see my family for the holidays. It was a month long trip. Hiring people who find pleasure in others pain is a terrible business plan for management. I have been working in Customer service for over 20 years and I understand that sometime you have to fake being nice. This manager did not fake being nice and smiled and laughed at the situation. I was shocked and so sad. Telling my mom I couldn\\'t come home for Christmas was the saddest phone call I have had since her mother passed away. I will never fly AA and continue to fly Southwest since they have never given me issues with flying and their flights are reasonably priced compared to AA. I am surprised by how many people have experienced similar issues with AA. How is AA still a company with terrible customer service?   This was my first trip in American\\'s 772 business class cabin. Their 772s have all been refurbished with the Collins Aerospace Super Diamond seat which is the same one found in their 789 business cabin, as well as new deliveries of their 788s. The cabin on this plane felt brand-new due to the recent refurb, despite the fact that the 772 is one of the older planes in the AA fleet. I\\'ve flown this same seat on American\\'s 789 both domestically and on a long-haul international leg from EZE-LAX and it is a very solid hard product. The seat is comfortable with good and adjustable lumbar support, and is a very modern design with clean finishes. The storage concept is a bit odd, in that there\\'s no place for a laptop, but that\\'s not a huge deal for me since American\\'s cabin has overhead bins. There are two things that I prefer about this seat on the 772 over the 789: privacy dividers between the D&H seats (center rows) and a definitely noticeably larger footwell area. There is one downside however about this seat in general, and especially the version on the 772 - the seatbelt. Yes, the seatbelt. I don\\'t really mind on the 789 version, which requires use of a shoulder strap during takeoff and landing. The 772 version does not have a shoulder strap but instead has a ridiculously thick and stiff pad around the lap belt which leaves little place for your arms if trying to sleep on your back or even recline without the seatbelt on. The seatbelt really would bother me on a long-haul. On this short hop from DFW to MIA I booked in economy but was upgraded to business. The service did not include a meal however the flight attendants were outstanding and more friendly than what I\\'m used to on American. I\\'d recommend this cabin, especially during a day flight. Other than the thick seatbelt, there would be no complaints whatsoever!  Peoria to Dallas with American Airlines. This airline allows 50 pounds maximum on each bag. My one bag had 45 pounds while the other had 53 pound.s They could have allowed this bags. But I was told to transfer 3 pounds to other bag to balance the 50 pounds. It took me 5 min and I have to miss my flight. I had to wait for 9 hours for next flight. Mean while my original flight was day before and got cancelled due to bad weather. My whole experience was pathetic and due to their baggage policy it got worse. I always go for Southwest, but they don\\'t come to Peoria.   We had a delay in Jamaica due to a storm in Philadelphia. When we arrived in Philadelphia trying to connect to our Pittsburgh flight, we arrived 3 minutes late to the gate and the boarding had closed. The woman called to see if we could enter and we were denied access. With a family member in a wheelchair, we had to travel through the airport to customer service to get booked on another flight and they were going to separate us and give us seats on the back of the plane (who does that to a person in a wheelchair?). The woman at customer service did get us better seating. Additionally, the airline makes too many assumptions, the airline seems to be more accommodating to their staff vs. to their customers.   This was the most horrible experience! American Airlines cancelled our connecting flight to London despite options to still catch our flight using other airlines. Their automated system cancelled our seats and reassigned, sold, upgraded them to someone else before working with us to try to rearrange our flight to make it. This was the first time we were flying first class to treat our kids as a reward for their graduations. This ultimately resulted in losses in excess in the cost of the flight tickets that we now have to fight them to get compensated. Buyer beware of American Airlines!   What bad attention from this airline, I reserved two tickets to go to Colombia to pick up my new puppy, to whom I made a reservation and a week before I called to verify that I could fly with her in the cabin of the plane and they assured me that yes, to a surprise today, March 17, I arrived at the airport at 2 in the morning to board the flight and when I arrived they told me that I cannot travel in my company, my dog. Since March 9, a new rule came out and it is that dogs cannot travel in the cabin, I said that why they did not warn me and they tell me that this is not their problem, that they do not have to warn anyone, and they spoke to me in a tone strong, the same thing happened to 2 other people on the same flight. That this company\\'s lack of seriousness, they don\\'t know how to treat customers, and they do not notice by letting passengers know if there are changes or not, as if one could have all the time in the world. Thanks American Airlines for leaving my puppy in Colombia and destroying my heart for not being able to bring it with me. Now i\\'m paying babysitter to take care of her until she I can bring her. For  the next or next passengers I hope they have more respect with them because you are disgusting.  Customer service over the phone is a very horrible experience. They are rude, unhelpful and unprofessional. My flight was canceled 4 times in the past 2 days and the representative I spoke with said my recent flight was cancelled due to the full staff not able to be there. After I told her it was unprofessional of them to keep rebooking me knowing that the staff will not be there she said it’s also due to bad weather, but only 2 Airlines including this one has been canceling flights all week. Now I’m stuck here in CA paying a ridiculous amount of money on hotels.   Do not fly American. We didn\\'t even get to our flight which had been scheduled for weeks now, because they had canceled it before we could even get on, and only offered us another flight at 10PM when we were supposed to leave at 2 PM on our original flight. Basically leaving us in the dust.   Chicago to Norfolk via Ottawa. Would not refund ticket price when we could not fly due to Covid 19. Our state is under a stay at home order, as is the state we were going to fly to.   Flown with them 3 times. Every time I flown with them planes are always delayed or canceled. Worse customer service I ever had. You can never talk to anyone, when you do you just get transfered to someone else. Lost my baggage when I made a claim just kept getting transfered to someone else via email. Asked to talk to a supervisor, they said they couldn\\'t help me. Worse Airline ever.   My husband and I booked with American Airlines for our honeymoon ~6 months in advance. We were flying from Arkansas to Liberia, Costa Rica. The route home changed several times but the route there stayed consistent until 3am the day we were to leave (I.e. the day after our wedding). Our original flight was set to depart at 8:10am with a connection in Dallas before proceeding to Liberia. When we woke at 5:30 (set to be at the airport 2 hours prior to departure) we saw a text informing us that our flight had been delayed, which would cause us to miss our connection in Dallas, so they changed our flight to a 6:45am departure. We were on our way to the airport within 10 minutes but weren’t even allowed to check in because the flight was already leaving. When we went through the line to talk to customer service we were told to “come back tomorrow and try again”. We went through a second time and were told we could wait on standby for an undetermined amount of time, as the next flight couldn’t get us there until midnight the following day (and as we were paying ~$800 a day for the resort in costs rica that would mean we were wasting a significant amount of money and cutting our honeymoon short by 2 days). We were given a number to call with any other questions. When I called the number I was informed there were no flights that could get us there any sooner, and when I asked for a refund so I could book with another airline I was told I wasn’t eligible because I accepted the flight change. It took requesting a supervisor and about 15 minutes on hold for them to determine the flight was changed without my consent. At that point I was given the option to take a flight to Dallas with the understanding I would be on standby waiting for a flight to Liberia from there or wait until the flight the following evening. When I asked for a refund to book with United, who could get me to Liberia by 2pm that same day, they said I’d lose my reservation for the flight home and I’d have to request it through their website (their whole demeanor changed at that point and they became very short and rude). It took my extended family calling and working their way through supervisors to get the route there refunded while keeping the return flights. On the return our flight home was again delayed several times. In summary it was the worst experience my fiancé and I have ever had with an airline.   I was booked with my 3 little kids from Panama City to Tulsa Our flight was delayed in Panama City because plane realized they didn’t have any fuel? Then kept having problems with getting fuel. We got to Dallas and our connecting flight was at 6:25. We arrived at 6:15 and they were just closing gates. I begged lady to let us on because I was traveling with 3 little kids. She kept telling me I had to go to different gate to get rebooked very hatefully. I went to other gate and got ticket for next flight in 2 hours. I went to the food area and got ONE beer and McDonald’s. I went to our gate to check in and to speak to manager about our connecting flight and Austin Farr said “I smell beer on you and have you been drinking”. I’m assuming he knew about me begging the other lady to let us on and I explained I was frustrated and traveling with 3 tired little kids. I said I had one beer at the food area in the airport and I could show him my receipt. He told me he could not let me on airplane because I smelled of beer and I once again admitted I had one beer and to check with the girl upstairs that sold it to me. He told me I needed to get coffee (at this point I was getting upset and my 3 kids were crying asking why the guy wouldn’t give us our tickets). I sat down in front of the gate thinking he was printing our tickets. My kids has been traveling all day and were throwing a squishy ball back and forth to each other. I kept walking up asking for our tickets and he kept telling me for an hour and a half he had our tickets but wasn’t sure he would let us on. He would fan our tickets in his hand when I would look at him showing me he had them. He then let everyone board and said “I still don’t know if I’ll let you on”. Then they closed gates and told me he didn’t like my attitude and my kids could have hurt someone with their squishy ball and he decided not to let us on. He taunted me for almost 2 hours and was so hateful. I was stuck in Dallas with 3 little kids and no luggage and my phone was dead by this time. I have never been treated like this anywhere and have never filed a complaint ever. I travel all the time and have never had any problems until this time. The whole time whenever another of the employees would walk up he would look our way and nod his head at us like we were outcasts. Then he actually said “I told you what you had to do to get on this plane and one of them was to get coffee and I never saw you attempt to get coffee”. I have never been so embarrassed in my life.   I wish I would\\'ve read reviews before booking my flight. American completely ruined the first day of a vacation for my family. Apparently constant \"maintenance\" issues and excuses for delays are very common with them. Weather was great, flight boarded on time, come time for take off, oh we have an issue, it\\'ll be 45 min. Then after another 30 come with more delays and excuses but then offer to allow people to get off the plane, but not other flights going to Key West so if you get off you\\'re SOL. After an hour and a half we were taken off the plane, told to walk to a completely different terminal, and gate, which isn\\'t an easy task at such a large airport. Eventually loaded on the second plane only to be left sitting for another hour+ before takeoff. The 3 hour delay meant the rental car place was closed when we arrived. Was my first and I promise will be my last American Airlines flight.   This has been the worst flying experience I have ever had. American Airlines should be shutdown or they should start a new hiring campaign with new standard operating procedures. When I arrived at the Airport in Rome, Italy it was about 5-6am. I took a bus from Napoli to Rome to make my flight on time. I was exhausted with no sleep. In Orlando, FL American Airlines employees work 24/7. They change shifts and cover each other, as expect in any airport. After waiting 1 hour and 30 minutes for the gate to open, I was first in line at the american airline counter. First of all, I should have never gone to the counter. I should have been able to check-in ONLINE - I didn\\'t have a CHECKED BAG. I had a CARRY-ON and was FORCED to go talk to an American Airlines employee at the counter (SUPER RUDE - ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE). They watched me and 10 other people make a line for 45 minutes before even acknowledging us. Once I made it past TSA the experience just got worst. The AMERICAN AIRLINES staff at the gate E41 was not only sarcastic but very rude. Once I made it INSIDE the plane it kept getting worse. I flew with DELTA on my way to EUROPE. If i knew then that DELTA was so superior to AMERICAN AIRLINES I would have never booked this flight. You guys charge $30 for wifi - DELTA CHARGES ONLY $5. The staff on the AMERICAN AIRLINES flight was rude, inconsiderate, and unprofessional.   I bought 2 round-trip tickets to Germany from Utah. My husband and I had been saving our money for a long time to take this trip. We bought the tickets in September 2021, expecting to fly in January 2022. As of December 2021, Germany announced \"red flag countries\", which meant all countries listed on a \"red flag\" list were required to quarantine for 2 weeks upon arrival in the country, due to Covid-19. The United States was placed on that list late December 2021. With our trip being 1 week long, a 2 week quarantine was not possible. We called American Airlines and were told by a representative that our tickets could be applied/credited for another time within 1 year of purchasing. In May, the US was allowed into Germany without quarantine, and we called American Airlines to apply our credit to a new flight. We were told that the previous representative had lied: our tickets were not eligible for credit, and we revoked our money when we canceled our tickets in January. We complained, and received $100 to spend by September 2022. With airline ticket prices as they are now, that is almost nothing. This trip to Germany was a huge goal for my husband and I, and we are nearly starting from scratch now, having lost all the money spent. American was not understanding of the situation, despite it being Covid-19 related. We are extremely disappointed and have tried to fight for more from American Airlines, but it\\'s been useless.   Unbelievable how terrible American has become relative to their peers. This is 5 consecutive terrible experiences with this airline for me. Each time some other cataclysm of nonsense. It’s so offensive how terrible they mismanaged bailout funds while furthering their own incompetence. They should have to repay the people for their own inexcusable failings. It’s a comedy of errors and inanity over here and I will never fly this horrible line again.   Seattle to Miami. Terrible experience on both flights. Had to check our carry on bags and then they got put on a 1.5 hour later flight and we had to wait in the airport for bags that never should have been checked. Our connecting flight had just arrived and 4 people we were traveling with didnt have enough time to get to the connecting flight, we tried explaining this to the American Airline person and she did not care, nor would she wait 1 second and the flight was early. On the way home our carry bags were checked once again and there was a delay at baggage claim so it took and extra hour after we landed to get our bags that again never should have been checked. They have zero customer service. I will be avoiding this airline at all costs.  Once again, American airlines disappoints! After boarding into the airplane, they tell us we have to wait an hour for a \"light that needs maintenance\". Then, 40 min before arriving into Lima, they tell us that due to a \"communication\" issue, the airport is \"closed\" and they need to reroute us to another Ecuador. Once we land in Ecuador, they tell us that they are taking us to Lima but we ran out of fuel so we have to wait for American Airlines staff to get to the airport from home, because they are not on site. we were in a full flight (no social distancing) for an extra 3.5 hours during a pandemic. To make matters worse, when I call to change my return flight, they tell me I need to buy another flight, because I bought economy, when it clearly said on their website  that they offer free change of flights. So they want to charge me 700 usd to buy another return flight when I explained I had a medical reason to change my flight. Pay the extra bit of money and save yourself the nightmare! American airlines customer service does not care about customers.   My husband and I were planning a vacation to leave Thursday return Tuesday. We are all packed and ready, house clean and late Wednesday we receive a text saying our flight has been cancelled! We have already scheduled dog boarding and hotel which we just lost a lot of money on this trip. We eventually received a text saying we can leave the next day at 5 am, no refunds on our expensive hotel due to last minute and this obviously cut our trip short. The next day we go at 5 am to only wait till 7.30 am for yet another delay. This is really bad but it gets worse. On our way back here we go again another text saying plane has delayed two hours after two hours another text stating 3 hours at the end of the day we had to stay additional night as it did not leave until the next day. Worse vacation ever! And no they did not offer food vouchers nor hotel voucher nothing but a printed one way ticket for the following day. I will be cancelling my AA credit card which they so happily announce on each trip! What a rip-off and very inconsiderate of other people. I cannot believer that a company would treat people in this manner, so sad.   This was the worst experience of my life. My fiancé and I were so excited about going on our first trip since Covid hit. However, 39 of us had our flight canceled after hovering over the airport in Dallas for almost 2 hours, due to the pilot not being able to land in a storm. Then we had to go to Waco for fuel and sat there another 45 min. Only to be told once we did land on Dallas that our flights were canceled. On top of that they made us check our bags so we didn’t have anything we needed. We were stranded at the airport and because the next flight to California wasn’t got another 2 days we all had to return home. So that means no bags, ( which we had to get delivered to our home) and wasted 2 days in the airport. We were lied to by the staff at Dallas airport. American Airlines is the worst, do not use them.  American has gone down due to poor customer service. Now they don’t wanna refund the money on top of all this. Save yourself and book with another company.  They continually delay our flight \"due to weather\" however other flights have left to the same destination. Why has out flight been delayed when others are flying to the same. They say its \"due to weather\" so they have no financial liability. So sick of American Airlines, we\\'ll miss our connecting flight and they won\\'t help out with a hotel. Never ever again, will we fly American Airlines. They suck, they lie and they aren\\'t a very good deal.   Very frustrated. They cancelled the flight due to weather (rain). Then They reschedule me on a flight by standby couldn’t get on the flight because they overbooked it. Then I had to go to a different city then I was originally booked to go to and they sent my luggage to that airport instead of the airport I landed in. I even went to customer service and asked to make sure my bags got to the right destination and basically they just tell you what ever to get you out of there face. I was told not to worry and it will get done and it didn’t. I understand that the industry is in trying times but they can do better.  I fly approximately 40-50 times a year for business with all major airlines within US and International, economy as well as business class. Never experienced such a bad customer service. Flight delayed twice. Horrible customer service, will never ever fly again with AA even if I have to walk thousand miles.   American Airlines hard product, planes, seats, inflight movies etc are in general excellent. I just wish American would recognize of try and doing something with crew training to address their attitude. Mostly on international routes the crew tend to be senior crew. There is no service, no kindness, no politeness. It’s spoils the whole aspect of what American has done with their hard product. On the flights yesterday, there was less than 70 people on the plane, the world has changed and airlines will have a fight in their hands to survive. Service will always be a key aspect of keeping the loyalty of their customers. Besides the flight yesterday I have taken 3 long haul flights with American in the last 6 months and the attitude of the crew has been the same in each. Compare the service with Delta & British Airways who it seems the crew have a totally different attitude to service. American could be the best of all airlines, it’s just their poor attitude crew totally let them down. I hope someone from American reads this. Going forward every passenger counts, all the airlines employees need to embrace that .   I paid for upgraded tickets through AAdvantage. I arrived at the airport 1 1/2 before my flight. When checking in the online check in indicated a $30 per bag fee although I am an AAdvantage member. We were directed to go to Customer Service to find out why. However, the line took 1 hour for us to get to the counter, where we were told that they didn\\'t know why it was charging us a fee and asked us to pay for the bags. After paying for the bags, we were told that the flight was now closed. So they put us on a later flight in separate horrible seats and told us to try to get a refund for paying for bags and enhanced seats we never received.   Our 1st flight was delayed, which led us to miss our connecting flight from JFK to London. We waited in the customer service line for about an hour and a half and were told that they had no flights for three days. They were also very rude to us. They did not offer any vouchers for food or accommodations (we did ask!) We were stuck in New York City with all kinds of things planned in Scotland. We called the customer service line and they were able to get us a flight the next day back to Phoenix and then to London. It took us three days to arrive to Scotland and we experienced a lot of stress and unhappiness, with absolutely no help from American Airlines. We missed a day and 1/2 of the trip we had planned for months. We also are out about $1,000 for incurred expenses. Upon returning home, I emailed to ask how to file a grievance, which is what the employee at JFK advised me to do. I have since heard from two people with no explanation of how to do this. The only thing that they sent is a $25 trip the credit for two of us. I’m completely insulted and flabbergasted by their lack of customer service and I will not be flying American Airlines again.   This review is about the lack a customer service and ignorance of American Airline\\'s employees. Traveling back from Mexico to Chicago my son was not allowed on the plane. He tested positive prior to leaving the US for Covid. Per new CDC guidelines and as posted on AA\\'s website and the US consulate in Mexico, he had a note from a certified physician clearing him for work and travel as well as a copy of the positive test. The ticket agent said because the test was not 14 day prior to his flight back to the US said he could not be allowed to board. There is nothing in any of the sources I listed that state this. When asked to meet with a supervisor we were told the decision was made and the supervisor could only be reached by email. We asked for a phone number and were denied. My son was threated with detainment if he did not leave. He went back to our resort at our expense and had to wait for a decision. Once I arrived in Chicago, I spent 1 hour and 43 minutes talking to 4 different so called customer service agents for AA. 3 times after several minutes I was disconnected. 2 of the 4 agreed with us that my son should not have been denied to board and 2 agreed with the Mexican ticket agent. How can 4 employees doing the same job have different answers for such an important issue? One word, incompetence.  Finally a very rude reservation supervisor said nothing could be done in the US and we had to deal with the Mexico airport? This was an AA error it had nothing to do with the airport. Our resolution was to book a flight the next day on a different airline. With the exact same documentation my son was allowed to board and is home safe.  My advise for international flights DO NOT USE AA. They do not know how to interpret CDC guidelines or train the employees.   The worst experience I’ve ever had trying to check in for an AA flight and getting charged $1250 for an upgrade that I did not get. After trying to upgrade from economy to premium economy and getting told that the “system” is not working and there are no two seats together, the clerk said we could ask at the gate or if we want to upgrade to business, she could do that for $600. I agreed to pay $600 for two of us to upgrade to business. I asked “600 total for two yes?”. The clerk said “yes 617.90 total for both”. She then took my card and processed $1250 on it. Then went “oops, seems it’s 600 per person” after the charge already went through. She could then not refund the amount and disappeared to get a supervisor who could also not do anything about it. Taking the whole experience to 2.5 hours of waiting at which point we had to leave with our original tickets to make it through security on time. And no refund. At the gate, different clerks said that there was nothing they could do to process any upgrades as they have the same system. When they called the original clerk they asked her why she tried to process business class tickets because a two level upgrade (from economy to business) is not even possible on American. To which the original genius had no answer. To make matters worse, when we got onto the plane (last to board) there was two sets of two seats together in premium economy, totally unoccupied. Which were then offered for free for the people in the first 2 rows of economy. The level of incompetence and lack of willingness to do anything to help resolve this is outstanding. I am still out $1250 and the final word from the clerks was that I would have to call American myself and ask to speak with the refunds department to request a refund for an upgrade that never happened. On my own.    Weather delay in LGA caused us to depart 2 hours late. By the time we landed in DCA, it was 15 minutes past our connection flight departure for HSV. Evening flight, so there was surely nobody connecting in HSV. They could have held the flight 20-30 minutes to ensure we could get home on time. Nope! Attempted to use the American Airlines App Chat feature. Both agents I ended up chatting with were completely useless. Earliest flight they could get us on was two days later, with no options given. When we arrived at DCA, we had to retrieve our checked bag so we had clothes. The girl working baggage claim was super rude, first telling us that there was nothing she could do, then only after we pressed she rudely said carousel 12 in 30-60 minutes. Went back to report the luggage was damaged, she was still super rude. Finally was able to get customer service to get my family on a next day flight, while I was on standby. Understood about the weather, but American Airlines has proven they don’t care about their customers. I am ending my frequent flyer with American. I will stick with Delta or United who actually take care of their customers.   I flew first class and this the second time that it\\'s been just horrible. I don\\'t know what\\'s happened to the service and quality that I have experienced in the past, but it\\'s certainly not made available to travelers today. The A/C wasn\\'t turned on, we had to get our own water and drinks, if they were even stocked on the plane. Flight attendants checked on us once, we had to put away our own cups before landing, the speakers were off during the safety briefings as we were getting ready to land, the meal that was served was cold. It was a horrible experience and I will not be flying American Airlines again. Don\\'t spend the money to upgrade, as it\\'s not worth it.  American Airlines sold me a ticket at the counter for a flight that I did not have enough time to board. My bags went and the gate had closed. As instructed by an AA customer service representative, I purchased another ticket and filed for a refund. AA is declining to give me a refund! Absolutely ridiculous. I never want to fly with AA again. It was their mistake and should fix it accordingly. I would not recommend this airline to anyone! Terrible customer service.  My flight New Orleans to Dallas was delayed so I missed my connection flight to Helsinki. Then it took AA 2.5 hours to find a new itinerary for me. That new itinerary was going to be Dallas - Dublin, Dublin to Helsinki and Helsinki to Vilnius, which added 15 more hours to my 20 hr trip and made me spend a night at Helsinki, and the airline didn\\'t even pay for the hotel. They call themselves American but the service they provide is awful and NOT American at all.   This is not a first time. Most of the time American Airlines staff don’t know the meaning of hospitality and they often treat customers so rudely. This time I almost missed my flight because of the staff as my flight was at 13.22pm and I was standing in a queue and person who was standing in front of me allowed me to go because it was already 10 minutes to 1pm. However the staff standing at the counter shout at me and said just go back and don’t come until I call you. Or else she would not allow me to board the flight. However she did not bother to listen to me. After a while I went to another counter and approached the staff and told her if I missed my flight then they would be responsible. My humble request to the administration kindly look after this kind of matter as we as a customer are facing this kind harassment due to your staff.   So I was supposed to go to Disney with my daughter for the first time April 18-26,2020. American Airlines canceled my trip due to covid 19. I totally understand that but now is a back and forth game with me getting a refund. I don’t want to rebook since I don’t know when I’m going to get a vacation again from work once we get back to normal. They still want to give me a rebook ticket, very upset I want my money and when only then when I get vacation time again I will book a trip.  Literally the worst. Do not book with American. Both flights were delayed making us miss our connection then the connection was delayed, dirty planes, unfriendly staff, awful airline communication. Don’t do it. You’ll be lucky to even make it to your destination if you travel via American Airlines. And one would assume during Covid there is more cleaning but nope! Nasty.  I was initially booked First Class on British Airways, but downgraded by BA to Business Class on Air Belgium. I did not wish to fly on British Airways charter to Chicago, so elected to fly on American Airlines who only have Business Class to ORD from LHR. I have not flown on American Airlines for some years, and hoped for a dramatic service improvement in Business Class trans-Atlantic. Sadly, the service on American Airlines is much worse. The cabin crew were surly, and inattentive. The food was literally inedible, and the wine selection a bad joke. The flight attendant almost threw the food at the passengers, with no smile whatsoever, and then disappeared for the majority of the flight. Absolutely atrocious service, and American Airlines should be ashamed.   Absolutely the worst. The flight was delayed. Then kept getting delayed so bad that I would miss my connecting flight. I had to get new flights so late and work the next day. Then they forced me to put my carryon as a checked bag which ended up getting lost because they put the wrong persons name on it. Now they have to ship it to me and I fly out again in 2 days and need that bag. I wouldn’t complain but this happens every time with them. I   My flight from Pensacola to Miami was delayed by 40 minutes due to plane maintenance. I asked the desk attendants and flight attendants if I\\'d be able to make my connection to Nassau with AA because that only left me 30 minutes between landing and take off. There were problems and delays getting off the plane, and I missed the doors to my connecting flight to Nassau by 2 minutes. They would not let me on the plane, and could not guarantee me a flight to Nassau this weekend because they were all booked. The attendants did not care about my situation. They simply kept saying there was nothing they could do, talk to this person. I keep getting passed on to the \"next person\" who is supposed to be able to help me yet I\\'ve gotten no help. I\\'m on standby, and this next flight is now also delayed. I keep being told conflicting advice, saying I\\'m able to have tickets refunded, but then I\\'m not eligible without canceling the remainder of my flights even though they are completely separate itineraries. I\\'m beyond frustrated. I\\'m pregnant and traveling alone and this just isn\\'t acceptable. This was my first time flying on American airlines and I will never fly with this company again. I want my money back for these tickets.   Buyer beware. Read the fine print before you fly this airline. Then don’t! My family and I purchased tickets from American Airlines to go for a Spring Break trip to Cancun, Mexico, leaving on a Saturday and returning the following Saturday. On our return flight through Charlotte, NC our flight was delayed on the ground for 30 minutes in Cancun. The airline only gave us 1 hour and 10 minutes to clear customs and make our connection in Charlotte, so due to the 30 minute delay, we missed our flight. When we inquired about another flight, we were told that American Airlines had no available flights until Tuesday of the following week! This was on a Saturday, so we were going to need to stay three nights in a hotel in Charlotte before they could get us home on Tuesday. My wife and I both work and our son is in high school, so there was no way that was going to work for us. We asked them to book us on another airline, they said they couldn’t do that even though all of the other major airlines had flights available the next morning. We asked if they could give us hotel and food vouchers, they said they couldn’t do that either, as it was against company policy and that we should have read the fine print on our tickets. Below is American Airlines official policy on delays (the fine print) “While it is certainly our goal to operate each and every flight as planned, we have the responsibility to make changes to our schedules to resolve problems caused by weather, flight conditions, mechanical difficulties or other operational challenges. Accordingly, it is not an airline industry practice to assume financial responsibility for our customers\\' personal time lost or for out-of-pocket expenses when extenuating circumstances prevent us from operating as planned.” In other words, they are not responsible for any delay, regardless of the reason, and they are under no obligation to take any measures to get you home in a reasonable amount of time. The fact that American Airlines could not find the capacity to get us on a flight for another three days from one of their hub airports, is ridiculous. The fact that they were completely unwilling to do anything at all to help us (and the 30 other passengers that were on the same delayed flight as us) speaks to how American Airlines values their customers. Which is not at all. We wound up booking a flight ourselves the next morning on Delta Airlines at the cost of $720 and staying a night in Charlotte for another $120 plus a meal. We are fortunate to have the resources to do that. Other members of our original flight were sleeping on the terminal floor when we left. One final comment, then I am putting American Airlines out of my mind for good. The next morning, we received a call from Delta Airlines telling us the first leg of our flight was delayed and that our connection in Atlanta was going to be very tight. They suggested that we switch to a flight through Detroit that would “get us home earlier and would be more comfortable for our family”. They also upgraded us to Comfort Class to make up for the inconvenience. That is how a real airline takes care of their customers.   Horrible experience, despite not using the return they refuse to return the money because they do and cancel when they want after canceling throughout the afternoon until 1 am in the morning, they offered flight the next day without security if the flight would leave or not, I had to buy another ticket for fear of losing my job which I had to report to the next day, I missed flight connections I had to pay for the covid test again and I got home almost 30 hours later due to lack of availability of flights. Please do not buy with this company, they are not responsible for anything with their clients.  Horrible experiencia, a pesar de no utilizar la vuelta se niegan a devolver el dinero a pwsar de que ellos hacen y cancelan cuando quieren después de cancelar durante toda la tarde hasta la 1 am de la madrugada, ofrecieron vuelo al día siguiente sin seguridad si el vuelo saldría o no, tuve que comprar otro pasaje por miedo a perder mi trabajo al cual debía presentarme al día siguiente, perdí conexiones de vuelo tuve que pagar prueba de covid nuevamente y llegué a casa casi 30 horas más tarde por falta de disponibilidad de vuelos antes, Por favor no compren con esta compañía no se responsabilizan por nada con sus clientes.   I was in line at DFW to board the plane A 20 , my group was called 5 and I approached the agent she said that I could not use the scanner and that I needed to use the other one, no problem, Then 5 seconds later she said to the lady behind me that she could you use the same scanner that I was told not to. Then I boarded the plane 10 minutes later she came aboard and approached a man one row behind me seat 12 A I believe, and started to berate him about asking questions to the gate people, this continued for 10 minutes she was inches face leaning over the 2 other passengers. I heard that if he did not comply he would be removed.  I am not a happy customer.   Most incompetent airline employees I’ve ever witnessed. We were supposed to go from Chicago to Miami, then Miami to Barbados for our honeymoon. We needed to present a negative COVID test to get into Barbados only. They wouldn’t even allow us to fly from Chicago to Miami because my wife’s link to the negative results would not open. Miami doesn’t even require a COVID test. So these employees almost ruined our entire honeymoon and couldn’t care at all about our situation. Luckily we were able to take a COVID test in O\\'Hare and still make it to the honeymoon, but we couldn’t leave until later that day, but this time through Delta.  I can guarantee I will never even think about flying with American Airlines ever again.   AA found the ipad mini I had left in my seat! While I filed a report on the ground in Des Moines, the baggage agent person did not give me much hope. After getting weekly texts saying they had not recovered it, to my surprise I got an email saying they had it! Today I received it in good condition and after a charge, all was good. I really appreciate the dedication to good service and the recovery of that item.   I was in the flight today and one of the flight attendants went above and beyond. We need more people like her, her name was Mckenna. Even though me and my kids had a rough day from Montreal to Philly but she still helped us and made us feel like everything will be alright. Thank you Mckenna for all you’re doing. Keep this great customer service skilled you have.   We were coming back home from sanibel and Disney but unfortunately they announced that the flight was full and they required 7 volunteers to stay the night in Orlando. But they sent us to the jetway for where we will sit. On this flight I had an autistic 11 year old and a 7 year old. Me, Nora, and Evie were on flight 1719 and my husband had to go on a flight that was landing by 8:30 and we decided for him to take an Uber home. So we were asked to not board until further notice the gate caller said and my husband’s flight took off by kinda around 6:30. We all thought that My husband was on Spirit but this was the worst travel experience we’ve ever had and we are not flying American ever again.   After 55 years of flying, as my father before me, to every major city in the US and to many countries abroad with over 100 flights annually, I can truely say I have had it with civil aviation. I never want to see another domestic carrier again. DFW/XNA this past Friday was one of the worst on record for me. A 42 minute flight was most deplorable. I have been tied to United, Delta, SW and even TWA, US AIR, Continental over the years until nearly all were absorbed by the Big 3. Now with AA exclusive since 1995. The perpetuated lies from pilots and maintenance personnel is just beyond the pale. It borders on harassment and being taken hostage. Yes the weather at DFW was sketchy on 10/28 but most every flight was moving in and out. I am OK with being delayed 2-3 hours if I am told the truth and updated, but 7 hours is horrid for passengers and AA staff. The lead FA and gate agent were on the verge of panic attacks because of the lies being told. The Captain just gets up and walks out without saying a word for he timed out on his duty hours. The FAs were furious he did this and they were calling their management over it. Secondly, How can a passenger expect they are being told the truth when you are told your aircraft \" has been taken out of service\" by maintenance only to reboard the same aircraft an hour later. I have my suspicions about that sequence of events but to long to go on in this forum. In the end the FAs saved us for they extended their duty hours to get us to XNA, otherwise we were screwed. Every passenger should be grateful to them as I was, even being 7 hours late. I read these comments about AA, it is shameful that a once premier domestic carrier and brand is now rated as a 2 star carrier. Its shameful that AA management does not care one ounce for their staff nor the passengers but only for the stock price of the shareholder. I don\\'t begrudge that but I want reliable service week in and week out when I travel on business and not the ongoing maintenance and operational stupidity that happens almost weekly. The new loyalty program is joke and only rewards those committed to a CC not the AA brand. So when booking AA, roll the dice and take your chances. I would hate to stake my vacation, honeymoon or cruise based on their service level. I doubt you are much better off with SW, Jet Blue, Alaska or United. Maybe Delta is the best bet in todays environment but with their 15,000 pilots threatening strike action I doubt they can be depended on either. Good Luck out there because civil aviation is no longer civil.   I had originally booked a flight for Sunday March 22, 2020 from LaGuardia to Los Angeles. I cancelled my reservation on the 20th of March because of the recent events with the coronavirus, and purchased a different flight. I sent an email to the email address provided through the AA website\\'s refund link, requesting a refund. I get an email 3 days after with a voucher that i did not request. I sent another email explaining that I did not request a voucher and requested for my money to be returned to my credit card. And the email I received was this Thank you for contacting American Airlines Customer Relations. I\\'m happy to help. I understand that you have questions about your voucher offer that you accepted on March 24th for NONAME\\'s flight that you canceled on March 20, 2020. I\\'m sorry to learn that you are unhappy with the voucher amount you were given in lieu of a refund to your original form of payment. The voucher versus refund offer that is currently being given, whereby customers may be offered a voucher for their non-refundable tickets that is offered exclusively through our online Refunds site, prefunds.aa.com, and are valid for specific tickets and scenarios. At the time you requested a Refund, the voucher amount given was what was being offered. At this time, a refund is not available to you as you\\'ve already requested and received a voucher for the full value of the non-refundable ticket. Susan, it may be helpful to know that while the eVoucher is nontransferable and cannot be sold or bartered, the voucher can be used toward the purchase of a ticket for a friend or relative if you prefer. Also, while the voucher must be applied to your purchase prior to the expiration date, the travel may extend beyond the date of expiration. Susan, while I wasn\\'t able to provide a refund to your credit card, as you requested, let me assure you that our position does not lessen our regard for you as our customer. It is always our pleasure to serve you, and I hope that we have the opportunity to welcome you both aboard again soon Sincerely, Deborah K McCoy Customer Relations American Airlines AA Ref#1-29180159256 They force words into my mouth claiming I accepted a voucher when I never did and was neve given the option to accept one or deny it. I\\'m extremely frustrated with this airline on top of personal belongings being damaged and I will never fly with them again. I never had this sort of frustration with United Air or Southwest.   American Airlines as usual delayed the flight by more than 1 hour and it is my first connecting flight and it got delayed by more than 1 hour. All other airlines should simply break ties with AA and don\\'t choose AA as connecting flight. Worst airline of the century when it comes to on time performance. Go AA only if you don\\'t care for time & have no dependency on arrival time.   Every time I fly American Airlines there is always a delay. This time we sat on plane waiting to take off for 2 hrs. Missing our connecting flight in Dallas. This airline does not care about its passengers, they don’t care about safety or if you miss your flight e aisles of there technical issues. If one flight is late and there is a lot of people on the delayed flight for connecting flight, they should wait for the passenger.  Their service is low budget. They’re unorganized and unpredictable. Take your money to Delta or Southwest. Never flying with them again in my life. Ruined our Trip. Now we have to sleep in the airport.   I recently paid $355.66 to upgrade to first class. My card was charged but they never upgraded my ticket and wouldn’t refund me. I have flown over 500 times with A.A. The planes, pilots, and in air staff are also nice. But the people who work the desks and answer phones are rude and uneducated. They have no clue how anything works. They’re rude. And quite frankly completely useless if it’s anything beyond putting a sticker on your luggage. With automated check in now they should just fire all of them. They’re a waste of money and resources. \\xa0 \\xa0Bucking a trend here I have mostly positive things to say. Although the flight was late (mechanical plus thunder storms) the experience up front has been very positive. The seat is one of the most comfortable lie flats (7L).The food was excellent and the service was friendly and efficient although clearly these women are having a tough time what with 2 weeks of stormy weather,massive holiday crowds, and entitled customers. They really provided what felt like an international level of service. The delays were handled professionally by the gate agents who also have had to had a rough go of it. Entertainment was great and wi-fi was excellent.  After being shunted onto a Charlotte flight (see previous review of London - Philadelphia) had a much better experience. Got 2 seats together on a flight about an hour later than our original. To my surprise they were the most comfortable Premium Economy seats I have ever flown in. Reasonably helpful F/A\\'s although their slightly offhand attitude when only \"shrimp\" meals were left was a bit off putting. We eventually got a Pasta dish. Generous with the wine servings. Good selection of in flight entertainment with noise reducing headphones. Flight took off and landed on time. Baggage off reasonably quickly at a quiet Charlotte airport. If all AA flights are like this I could recommend.   American Airlines travel is always the worst experience every time I travel. From the check-in counter to the arrival gate and everything in between, I get unprofessional interaction with AA personnel. The COS front counter today was a total fail (on an extremely slow day). Delay after Delay after delay. This is the experience every time I travel from COS to DFW. Should\\'ve driven back to Denver and traveled with Delta. Keep thinking they will get their act together, but not yet. Chances that arrive at my final destination today or slim and none. With the prices AA charges for flights, you\\'d think they would get some aspect of the travel experience correct. Such a disappointment.   Received a document number for a voucher but not the actual voucher. When I called to book a flight they couldn’t find anything and just said they needed the voucher number, even though I had the document number it wasn’t good enough. So basically, my money that they have already taken, cannot be used because they can’t find a voucher number. Customer service was also extremely rude, I’m not disrespectful and understand things happen but this is the second time I’ve had issues with their vouchers and customer service NOT helping.   American Airlines is a complete joke. I experienced delays on every leg on three consecutive trips. Not one flight out of 10 was on time. Because of this, I missed my connecting flight in Chicago and had to take the next one at 5:00 AM, leaving at 3:00 AM to get to the airport. Your money will be wasted with this company. It is absolutely unethical that they waste their customer’s time and money. One upside was that staff were fairly helpful with rebooking.   We had booked a flight for our honeymoon for June 2nd. The airline canceled our flight and without giving us any options, gave us airline credit. However, we have so far been unable to use our airline credit. It took over 5 hours to get someone on the phone because we couldn\\'t use it online, only by phone. Now, they are \"checking the policy\" to see if we can even use it. This is a complete scam and we want our money back. \\xa0 \\xa0My most recent experience has been the worst yet, with my flight being canceled and rescheduled multiple times. The incompetence and lack of communication are astounding. To make matters worse, the rescheduling resulted in an overnight delay, completely ruining my plans. This isn\\'t an isolated incident; I\\'ve faced this issue multiple times with American Airlines. It\\'s incredibly frustrating to deal with the constant uncertainty and poor service. They clearly don\\'t value their customers\\' time or convenience. If you want a reliable airline, look elsewhere because American Airlines will only give you headaches and stress.   I visited to Los Angeles last week. I made reservation with American Airlines and the seat was very comfortable. Food was delicious. Very caring for Senior Citizens. Overall I can say that it was really good. I also recommend it.  First, I would like to make note of the flight attendants. We had two really great and humorous flight attendants who did what they could to make our interactions enjoyable. However, I will avoid flying with this airline in the future for the following reasons: 1) Seating. They will not seat you with your family or friends unless you purchased this option. You will likely be separated from them, even if you purchased tickets at the same time. 2) No online check-in. Despite the terms saying that you can check-in online 24 hours prior to flying (where you supposedly can arrange seats on international flights), this is not allowed for international flights. I attempted to log-in multiple times the day before flying and calling the airline, but wait times were over an hour. I spoke to other passengers who also were unable to check-in online before the flight and this experience was the same. 3) The food is not good. I ordered the Asian-vegetarian meal in advance which normally means on the Atlantic US flights that you\\'ll get Indian food. The rice was undercooked and it was so incredibly spicy my stomach hurt. 4) The flight attendants weren\\'t working. Despite my positive interactions with the flight attendants, I saw them taking a lot of breaks. The airline had blocked the entire back middle row (4 seats across). I understand they need breaks, however, I have never seen flight attendants reading and watching films. Shouldn\\'t these seats be available to the passengers? Not once did I see them walking around offering beverages during the pauses in between meals. 5) The seats are awful. I got stuck in the seat in front of the bathroom on the side. This seat barely reclines and the seat in front of me was broken and the woman left her seat reclined the entire time, so I was unable to properly view the screen or have much space to move.  I\\'ve had roughly 60+ flights a year for the past 10 years for work. I\\'ve learned from the past to avoid American. They delay more than any other airline to the point it is beyond obnoxious and inconvenient. I will opt for longer trips, more expensive trips, and whatever else to avoid. From what I\\'ve heard, they have poor management which aggravates employees. They then take it put on us by creating delays by using any little rule they can find to make life worse for us. Recently I\\'ve flown AA from SHV to SAT and ONT to MAF. The first was canceled. The second was delayed to the point I missed my connection and have to find a hotel. Avoid them at absolutely all costs. Hopefully they go bankrupt so someone worth something can pick them up out of insolvency.  Two flights in 60 days that have made my fiancee and I miss appointments. I literally cannot get anyone at American to answer the phone after being on hold for over three hours last night and over two hours this morning. I am a Platinum Advantage member as well. Their customer service is absolutely ludicrous and I would warn everyone to have a very low expectation of American Airlines.  WORST AIRLINE EVER. I have a credit card with American but I’m DEFINITELY canceling it because today was the last straw. I arrived with my family at our destination at 11:40. Now we have a cruise planned that we have to be there by 2 for our check in time. It is 1:44 when I am writing this. American has our bags hostage and gets mad at its  customers for asking where the heck our bags are. American please notify your customer about the status of baggage because when you don’t, then you create panic and can’t get mad at people for questioning what happened to their stuff especially when the customers pay for their baggage. If I could give a zero star review I would. American is literally like Spirit Airlines, but Spirit is starting to get a little better and they are cheaper.  I had scheduled a flight for myself and my sons to visit a potential academy for them. I decided to treat them to first class since they had done so well. We arrived two hours before as instructed and the front counter didn\\'t even open or show up for 45 minutes later only giving us a little over an hour to check in and get through security and get on our plane. Then even though it was showing on time the plane was not being loaded and it took till after we were supposed to leave to find out that our pilots were not here yet. We were told \"they are on their way\" multiple times till finally we were told the truth that they had timed out the night before. They were not going to be able to leave till later anyway. They knew this when we were able to check in at 3:45. they could have told us then. IF they would have, I could have then driven to Dallas myself and made my connecting flight which was on time and all would have been good. Instead, they made us late and because they wouldn\\'t move the plane out of the way they made at least the next two flights also late because our plane was just sitting there. They could have even changed flight crews to let us use the next flight\\'s crew and everything would have still been good. That is not the worst. They not only made us miss the connecting flight, but then we got bumped down in class and could not sit with my children on the flight. Then when contacting them about this, the only thing I wanted was to get refunded my charges for first class. Which per ticket would be $500 plus dollars per ticket. Instead, they are dragging their feet doing so and only refunded $158 per ticket, which is far less that reasonable and ridiculous to say that is the only difference between first and coach. Then I even sent from their own site the cost of first class and coach on same flight booked the same amount of time in advance and still no response. I am only asking for the right thing to be done. I was still able to get to my destination, but people plan flights according to their schedule and to be held up like this for no reason cost several people to miss some very important events they had planned. One example was a cruise a retired couple was taking. The ship left without them because they were not going to be able to get there till the next day because of this.   It is with deep regret that I am writing this letter to explain the series of misfortunes we had in our experience with your airline. On July 23rd, my wife, 4-month old daughter and I were scheduled to fly from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv with a connection in Miami. We were astonished to learn that parents with an infant were prevented from selecting seats online and especially via a representative. This seat selection blunder ended up getting us the worst seats on the plane, which might have been the least of our problems with American Airlines. On our way to the airport we saw that our flight was an hour delayed. As we did the check in, your AA representative said this would not be a problem and we will still make the connection from Miami to Tel Aviv. So, we proceeded with the check-in and went through security. After an hour waiting for boarding, we saw that the flight was delayed for an additional hour. This of course meant we would miss the connecting flight to Tel Aviv. The staff at the gate told us to speak to the staff at the customer service booth at LAX. The service at the AA booth had us waiting for over an hour in line, and almost made us miss our flight! After waiting for almost an hour, we were only told by customer service representative to go on the flight and the staff in Miami will have to guide us on what to do next. When we boarded the flight, they told us we needed to check in one of our carry on\\'s that contained all of our baby stuff for the flight and when we said we needed it with us - they told us we are the last ones. And said, that it is our fault we needed to check in - mind you, we were only late because we were standing in customer service line for an hour. This lack of foresight, care, and empathy for a family traveling with an infant is beyond me. And is a true reflection of the character of this airline. When we landed in Miami around 9pm, we got off the flight and immediately were sent to re-booking without our luggage. When we tried to find our luggage we were told it was on hold because we were supposed to have a connecting flight which we missed due to the delay. We were in line to re-book for over 2 hours. When we finally got to rebook a flight to Tel Aviv, we were told that since all American Airlines hotels are full they were unable to offer us any accommodation and we need to pay out of pocket for accommodation, transportation, new covid test and food. As far as we know the airline must provide accommodation and food vouchers if a flight has been cancelled or delayed due to the airline\\'s fault. We ended up paying $350 to rent a car so we can get to our hotel, we paid $400 for 2 nights for accommodation, we had to do a new rapid covid test which cost us $150 ($450 for the 3 of us), in addition to $300 for food cost, and an extra $100 for clothes and diapers since we didn\\'t receive our luggage. Our total expense sums up to $1600.   They gave our seats away well before the flight left (more than 15 mins), and well after we checked in. Staff member at the gate was horrible, rude, snide. Sat on phone for 1.5 hours before anyone would speak to us. Only one line at airport to talk to ticket agent. The line was well over 2 hours long (were finally able to get operator, so got out of that line). Had to spend the night in Miami. No compensation for accommodations. Plus lost hotel room $ for the night we didn’t get to St Maarten. Plus they lied multiple times about our baggage which they sent to St Maarten while we were still in Houston. Seems they are over-booking every flight. Then blaming the passengers. And charging additional money for ticket, or else forced to fly stand-by. Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had flying.   Worst airline ever. Can never get you to make your connecting flight. From Ohio to Savannah they delayed my first flight so I then miss my connection. Luckily Southwest Airlines bailed me out and got me to my destination so I didn’t miss my grandfathers funeral. On the way back to Ohio we again get delayed on first flight and miss the connection. Best part is we had 10 minutes to run through the airport to catch the connecting flight and turns out the connection left 5 minutes early. Way to go! Now my son and wife are sleeping on the floor at the airport waiting to get home.   Terrible! Was on connecting flights, both were delayed. Took 9 hours to get from JFK to IAH airport. On way home, took 7 hours. Couldn\\'t get my carry on bag on because \"compartments\" were crowded. Had to walk over 20 minutes to baggage claim and then wait 15 minutes for baggage to arrive.   Usually choose to fly with American Airlines out of Savannah, but not anymore. Was issued a \"flight credit\\' In September of 2021, but they wouldn\\'t honor it in February of 2022 because the original purchase date was Jan 2021. This flight credit shows up on my account and states \"Don\\'t worry, the value of your ticket is safe.\" Well that is a lie because after speaking to them on the phone they would not honor it. Worst customer service.  Moral of the story, don\\'t trust what your account says because they may not honor it in the end. Will not book with American again.  As a twelve year military veteran, I’ve spent a significant amount of time on flights all over the world. In that time, I’ve never felt the need to write a bad review until American Airlines. Prior to the start of the trip, we had to rebook multiple times and reschedule plans due to the airlines canceling flights and expecting us to deal with their total lack of organization via email and numerous phone calls. During our first flight home, they canceled our connecting flight three separate times. They ultimately rescheduled us for a flight that departs 25 hours later. Bear in mind, we had originally paid extra to get an early flight home and now we’re an entire day late. We spent 30 minutes attempting to locate any American Airline employees to help in the airport. We finally located the “Admirals Club” (a club to supposedly help American Airlines guests) and asked for assistance switching the destination to a closer airport so we could rent a car with our own money and the guy refused to help us because we weren’t card members. Not only did he refuse to help us, but he proceeded to mock our circumstances and went as far as having the audacity to ask if we wanted to sign up for an American Airlines credit card because he would then, and only then, be able to assist us. If you want to pay thousands of dollars to be treated as if you don’t matter, American Airlines is the place for you. I’m going to happily spend the next 25 hours on every travel review website explaining just how our experience was, to hopefully advise other travelers to book elsewhere and help them avoid enduring this horrific experience.   Stressing, the flight was delayed for an hour, after 1 hour and 30 minutes later, we got in the airplane and we waited for another hour. So, at the end we waited about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Then they change us to another plane in another gate.   I have top tier Alaska status and have started flying American more because of the new One World partnership. Miserable employees and terrible customer service have been a consistent theme with American on almost all of our trips, but this trip was likely our last straw. We were delayed an hour and 20 minutes due to a mechanical issue coming out of New Orleans. Our layover was only 45 minutes in DFW, so unfortunately this moderate delay meant we’d miss our connection. No problem, this was an afternoon flight, there are 2 more flights from DFW to SFO. American oversells their flights out of DFW and bumps so many passengers that all flights to SFO were fully booked until 6 PM the following day, or just under 24 hours after we were supposed to land. Keep in mind that’s like 6 flights that are booked out. We’re ok to go to San Jose or Oakland to try to get home same day. Nope, nothing there either. I see options to divert on united, delta, and JetBlue to get home before 1 AM and not miss another day of work. Their contract only covers united and delta diversions and they don’t see these options in their system. Ok, can the customer service team escalate? No… if it’s not on their computer screen, there’s nothing they can do. And I have top tier one world status, would hate to not have status. I’ve had this situation happen before, American somehow took possession of a British airways reservation during a check in screw up by their agent last year which meant BA could not physically check me into the flight that I was supposed to be on. the phone agent in the UK for American successfully diverted me to a virgin flight to help rectify the mistake that would have kept me in London several extra days due to flight schedules and availability. Crisis averted, the agent went above and beyond and fixed the mistake. These American agents stateside would not hear of such a thing, they don’t call other airlines. I ask to speak to a supervisor. They take around 15 minutes and then get back on the phone and just tell me “this is so and so, she will explain how things work to you.” Probably the worst phrase you could say to a frustrated customer and a basic customer service mistake. Basically, “I’m not going to listen to you, you listen to me.” Awesome. So now I’m on with the supervisor, and she repeats his lines. Not willing to call. If it’s not on her screen it doesn’t exist to American despite flight availability online. And he was their chief advisor so if her employee couldn’t figure it out, no one could. I fear for those that get the non customer advisor customer service people. She isn’t able to help, I’ll deal with it at the airport. At the airport, our checkin person was probably new as she had to ask for help a number of times, but we had a weird situation and she did her best. She was very polite. We accept that we need to fly out the next morning and they’ll put us up at a hotel in Dallas during our layover. We land at 7:20 and are out at an airport holiday inn, which is fine. They have a shuttle, great. We call for the shuttle, it’s going to be 15 to 20 minutes. Not Americans fault on this part, but we were picked up an hour later and then drive around the airport for another hour before heading to the hotel. Not joking. We check in at 10:30. Just insult to injury at this point. We eat some cold delivery dinner and try to get some Zs. Never again American. Well pay extra to fly with anyone else.  I flew from San Antonio to Dallas for work. Without a doubt, it was the worst flying experience I\\'ve ever had. They canceled the flight 10 minutes before boarding due to maintenance issues. It took 3 hours to reschedule at the airport\\'s customer service desk. After a missed meeting and hours wasted, I was \"generously\" offered a 50-dollar voucher after an online complaint. Given the option to ever fly American again, I would rather walk to my destination.    An airline that\\'s only good for carrying freight, not passengers. For a country that prides itself on being advanced, it\\'s shameful that such a low-quality airline is offered to customers. Apart from the poorly maintained planes, which sometimes have water leaking from the ceiling, the food served is worse than prison food. Charging for checked baggage and not providing headphones to passengers are other major flaws of this terrible airline. The service was extremely poor, and the food was served in low-quality plastic containers, which were not suitable for hot meals. Passengers, lacking headphones, had to play their TV audio out loud or use their phones at high volume, causing disturbance to others. Overall, it is truly a bad airline.  Paid $29 for their WiFi to stream a hockey game and the WiFi is too slow for that. So do not pay the money if you want to stream anything. Reason I paid is because they did not have the option to watch the game. Also, no food besides the complimentary snacks on the plane. 6.5 hour flight and not even option for dinner. Finally, no alcohol aboard on the plane besides first class. No understanding any of the reasoning behind these decisions and definitely can not disagree with any of it because you will get in trouble. I will not fly with American any time in the near future.  For the fourth time this year American Airlines has delayed a flight with no rhyme or reason and taken 3 hours away from my trip. No big deal to them but a pretty major deal to me since I have very limited time to visit home. If I can help it I will never ever fly this airline again. This is so ridiculous I don\\'t see how they can treat people like this.   This review was in regard to the first leg of my trip. Check in was a breeze done online, the terminal at JFK was jam packed by 6am and it took about 45 minutes to get through security. Once we had boarded we were informed that the front tires had to get some air added but about ten minutes later we were asked to de board the plane due to the tires having to be changed. About an hour later we boarded again. Due to me having a very tight connection in Miami the flight attendants upgraded me mid-flight to premium economy in order to get out of the plane fast. Crew was very friendly and the flight was comfortable. A soda and biscuits were offered on the two and a half hour flight.   We were on a trip up north when my Mother passed. Not only did the agent help me find a new flight at the same price, she sent me a very nice condolence card. This was above and beyond normal and very much appreciated.    Total nightmare. My flight home was canceled after standing in the airport for over 8 hours with no updates. After they announced the cancelation, they then told us that we were on our own finding accommodations and that they were not giving vouchers. There were hundreds of passengers tossed on the streets of Providenciales to fend for themselves. I ended up paying $1200 for 1 night at a local resort, the only thing many of us could find. They told us at the airport that we would need to foot the bill then claim it. Then they wanted me to sit in Philadelphia waiting 8 hours for my connecting flight which was originally to take me to Buffalo NY. Well, after they rescheduled my flight, they wanted me to sit in Philly all day then fly to Charlottesville, NC to spend the night. That would have caused me to lose a 2nd day of work due to this fiasco. There were no vouchers offered so I would have had to pay for another hotel and transportation in my own. I finally made it home 2 days later. I am still fighting with this irresponsible airline to reimburse me for my accommodations in Provodenciales. They did this to hundreds of people and have shown no concern for making this right. I will never fly with them again. They lied and treated us terribly.   I had a very traumatic experience trying to come home from Europe with my service dog to make my mother’s funeral. Even though I was assured it was on all my flights it wasn’t. This time I wanted to be sure to avoid such unpleasantness. I went to the airport personally serval times and even purchased my ticket at the counter (very expensive) I even upgraded to first class! Each time I asked about traveling with my service dog I received contradicting information. When I called I would reach someone who barely spoke English with back ground noise that made the call incomprehensible. Finally I found a professional at the end of the phone and she helped me upload all my documents three to be precise in a way that the ”System” would accept them. She assured me all my paperwork was complete and I was confirmed on both of my flight to Cancun and gave me a record locator number. When I checked in at Louisville all went smoothly when I reached Charlotte the agent attending the flight told me no service dog was confirmed on the flight and I would have to find the service desk and deal with the problem. I had also requested wheel chair assistance (which never came). I was forced to stand for over thirty minutes while an extremely unsympathetic supervisor waited on hold to get the authorization I had already spent weeks getting. I was told that they would put me on a latter flight which meant I would arrive in a foreign country as a woman alone and try to speak Spanish, rent a car and find my way to my lodging! I became nervous and was told I could not board the aircraft because I could not obey orders. Finally after I became to upset and confused I left important documents I needed for my service dog to enter Mexico on the counter. After being extremely traumatized I was told I “Could” board the plan. A fully armed police man stood at the gate while Kiki and I were still waiting for clearance in the “computer”. At last I boarded but in my traumatized state I left the documents behind. When I arrived in Mexico I realized they were gone. The Mexican claims department told me they would try to get them put on the next flight and deliver them with my “lost” baggage. I delayed the delivery of my lost bag to await the arrival of my documents. The next day I was told that the supervisor refused to accommodate my request and the documents could only be sent to a USA address. Also when I finally received my bag a valuable item was missing. I think I can get this kind of treatment from one of the other cheaper airlines. Thank you American.   Very rude and unorganized, apparently you can have adult beverages on the flight from Key West only if you are in first class. I asked for a glass of wine in business class and they refused. When getting on the plane in Dallas I had to go back up to the boarding area to retrieve a red tag to check my carry on after she said go ahead with it but the impowered flight attendant turned me around at the plane. No customer service, just rude employees.   Making me check my carry on when there is more than enough of over head bin space annoyed mef. If I wanted to check my bag I would have done it in the beginning. I got on the flight and saw plenty of space. Customer service is trash when you have an issue. They don’t care! Had way too many issues to count with AA.   AA was the worst airline I’ve ever flown and I fly often using Delta. I was suppose to arrive at my destination close to 1pm. I get things happen and weather permitting, etc. but I had to switch flights multiple times, multiple connecting flights were missed… I was stuck on a plane for 55 minutes while they decided they needed maintenance to come fix two lights on the aircraft in the aisle. It was hot and there was no air on. Everyone was sweating and complaining. Granted another delay that was about an hour was to sit on the plane and wait till the weather in Chicago got better. I understand that. But then I had an elderly man behind me on one aircraft that was on oxygen and needed a plug to charge it and the lady told him there was none and that “oh there is one but it probably doesn’t work.” So the elderly man and everyone around him was nervous and scared the whole flight. The staff on multiple planes was very rude and unhappy. I didn’t end up to my destination for about 6 hours after I was suppose to and after all the flight changes I encountered, I ended up having to fly to a different airport in Houston where I then had to get an Uber back to the airport where my rental car reservation was that was unable to be changed to a diff location. Not to mention one of the aircraft was out of almost everything to drink!  Delays are ridiculous, connections are tight, and care for the customer is non existent. I missed my connection because my flight was delayed. I was told 5 times at the first airport that my connecting time was still \"legal\" because it was more than 30 minutes but my flight didn\\'t end up landing until 12 minutes before my connection departed. I made it to the gate before they finished letting on standby passengers but they had already given away my seat and refused to let me on the plane. Then at customer service, they couldn\\'t get me out until late the next day but, since the delay was \"weather\" related, they refused to provide me with any hotel or meal vouchers. Then, at the gate to the next flight, they made me check my bag. Keep in mind that this bag had been fine on the last flight and all of my other flights this week. Now, I\\'m sitting here waiting for this flight to finally depart but we\\'re delayed again due to maintenance. I\\'m beginning to wonder if I\\'m ever going to get home.   My flight from Miami to Madrid was scheduled to depart on June 29th 2021 at 5:35 PM. Around 4:40 PM, groups 1-6 were able to embark; then, the crew stopped the embarking arguing that people were getting wet while embarking, how was that happening? It is difficult to understand since the the boarding bridge is covered. Anyway they delayed the embarking of passengers for longer than an hour. Later, when the rest of the passengers were embarked, they kept us for two hours inside the plane, and then they announced there were no pilots available to fly at that time. The process to rebook the flight was a nightmare, long lines, moving from one gate to the a different one, starting the line all over again, the flight was rescheduled for next day at 11:00 am. On June 30th were getting ready to leave to the airport and then we got an email stating that the flight had being rescheduled again at 7:45 PM with a stop in London. Originally, we paid additionally for seats and when the flight was rescheduled no seats were assigned, we lost two days in hotels in Madrid and that were paid in advance. Who is going to pay for money, time and stress caused by this irresponsible company? One more thing, they announced they did not have head sets for economy class so, passengers were supposed to get their own ones. I would like to add that this is not the first time that I experience the same situation with American Airlines. I deeply regret I used American Airlines when I planned my travel.   A truly uncomfortable flight. Because of the short connecting time I paid for a preferred seat nearer the front. What a disaster. Turns out it was a no recline seat; not designated on their charts? On top of that the seat in front of me was clearly a full recline; I estimate 6\" to 8\". I got to spent a full 5+ hours with someones head in my lap as she left the seat reclined even when not sleeping; and had to be prompted to put in in the landing position! The leg room situation was a joke; no space at all. The seat was probably a bit wider; a good thing because I had to sit sideways to clear the magazines. The idea of opening my computer was not viable. I an just under 5\\'11\". And obviously dumb enough to fly AA\\'s A320\\'s across the country. Not again!   AA cancelled our flight. Ok, we lose a day of vacation in Turks and Caicos. We get re-booked on the same flight for the next day. AA cancels that flight too, just hours before takeoff. These were morning flights on good weather days. I have lost all trust in AA.   Left for our honeymoon on June 7th to fly from Columbus to Dallas and Dallas to Cabo. We arrived at the airport at 5.30am, our flight to Dallas was supposed to start boarding at 7.30am, at 7.00am was canceled then at 7.30am was reinstated and then at 8.20am was canceled again. Had to then get a new flight from Columbus to Chicago and then Chicago to Cabo. The night before we left to go home I get a notification that our flight home was canceled. FYI you can not call American Airlines from Mexico. We had to go to the front desk and everything and can not reach them. My in-laws called and was on hold for 2 hours and my in-laws booked us a flight through Delta because I needed to work Tuesday and by the time I got home it was almost 3am Tuesday morning. Our trip was awesome in Cabo. The traveling had me in tears with all the issues. I highly highly recommend not traveling with American Airlines!   Original boarding time was 8:05 pm, first delay was 2 hr, 2nd was 1 more hour and 3rd time 2 additional hours, then I requested a different flight. The employee said they had one seat going to Lexington open and I had 15 min to get there and she would call to let the gate know I was on my way. After from gate l21 to G9 I arrive to find out that the plane had already departed. It became a bit of a joke trying to just get something arranged to return me for my already late flight. After being rudely spoken to and jumped through all their hoops I can honestly say the overpriced tickets are no way shape or form worth the trouble. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I do not recommend flying with them   After a long anticipated wait our time to go to this paradise island was ruined by this incompetent airline. Our flight was scheduled for departure from Miami on 5:18 PM. The flight was pushed back until 7:00 pm then 9:00 pm and now it is 10:34 and still not boarded. The Incompetence of this airlines and the total disregard to customers time, is mind boggling. On a four day trip to the island, thanks to this airline we lost one whole day now. We will get there by 4:00Am. Our   Terrible customer service. Hard to get ahold of. Several hour wait to speak to someone. Will not work with you. No flexibility. Would not book through them again.   I have been flying for 55 years and worked in the airline industry for 12. This by far has been my worst experience Ever! I checked by bag into Jacksonville airport about and hour and 20 minutes before my flight. The security line was not exceptionally long, BUT, it moved slower than any security I have ever experienced. They only have 2 security screening lines to screen bags. I got to the gate 3 minutes before my flight was suppose to leave because of the line in security, and the plane was gone. The gate agents were extremely rude and offensive. (It\\'s not our fault that you werent at the gate) They were very unhelpful. They booked me on a flight that left at 7:45 out of Jacksonville the next morning, when there was a flight that left at 5:45. I had to have the morning crew rebook me on the earlier flight after a horrible night in the airport and the gate agents being rude and aggressive toward me. (This gate closes, you cant stay here! You have to go outside of security.) Then when I got to Dallas, the gate was changed 4 times. I went from D concourse to A concourse then back to D and then different gates as well. I was not able to get on the first flight but was able to get on the second. When I finally got to Salt Lake City, they had lost my bag and I did not get it until the next day. I should have gotten into Salt Lake City at midnight on Saturday and did not get to my destination until Sunday afternoon. There was not one, I am sorry, let me see what I can do to help. Just a whole lot of rude abrasive people that I came into contact with. This is the abbreviated version of the horror that happened to me on my return flight to see my son and grandchildren. Needless to say, I will never fly on American airlines again!   I am thoroughly disappointed with my travels with American Airlines this time, and I will likely not take AA anymore in the future, even with credit still left on my account. I booked a round-trip direct flight from DCA to LAX 3 months in advance. However, without explanation, both flights were changed to layover flights with a stop in Dallas. Then, they changed my seats without explanation. Even worse, my flight from LAX to DFW was delayed, causing me to miss my connection from DFW to DCA. In addition to the delay, the connection time of merely 40 minutes was unacceptable. Furthermore, AA changed the gates last minute for my flight into DFW and my flight out of DFW, causing me to run through 2 terminals only to be blocked at the gate even though there were still about 15 minutes left. I now have to stay at a hotel overnight, miss a whole day of work, and pay for meals and travel fees out of my own pocket. The worst part, their compensation to me was a 12-dollar meal voucher.   Stranded now in Chicago for 48 hours by American\\'s lack of planning to have adequate crew. No compensation of course. Long slow lines to talk to few customer service people about rebooking and where to get luggage returned for unexpected stay. Now on hold for over 1.5 hours already to get info about refund. That info is not available on line. Thunderstorms expected tomorrow so I am renting a car to drive from Chicago to Portland Maine since I have zero confidence my flight will take off tomorrow night. Will never fly this airline again and plan to tell everyone I know.   American Airlines left us and at least 100 other passengers to fend for ourselves in Charlotte. We ended up driving the 900 miles to Boston because, unlike AA, we take our jobs seriously. We flew to Punta Cana with our son, daughter-in-law, and grandson for a week of relaxation. Flight leaving DR was delayed by more than 2 hours due to \\'equipment issues\". Nothing was said in-flight about connections not being held in Charlotte. We cleared customs, had to go back through TSA and R A N to the connecting gate. Plane was still at the gate but gate agents refused boarding. We were told we had to go to customer service which had a 2+ hour long line. AA Screwed so many people that there were no hotel rooms left. We, and many others, slept on the grubby floor with assurances we would be on the 8 am flight Sunday. That flight was overbooked. Maybe the 10am? Not a chance, but we should stay there and keep trying. When finally asked a very direct question the gate agents confessed there was no way to get us out of there before Tuesday! 96 hours later than the time AA contracted with us by way of our paid tickets. That is unacceptable in any business. From the second the PC flight was delayed, American Airlines knew exactly where every passenger was and where they need to go. They made no attempt to get any of us where we needed to be. This could have been done while we were enroute. The attitude of the AA employees was that somehow this was the fault of the passengers. I wish I had looked up their abysmal record before we let our agent book us with our travel plans. Never again.   My family and I planned our annual snowboard trip to Park City and we chose to fly American because they had the latest departure on our return flight home. We always snowboard the last day of our trip and then fly home in the evening. Well, American messed that all up for us. Both of our initial flights were changed and the only flight they had available to return home was so early that we were not able to board the last day of our trip, even though we purchased tickets in advanced and had to eat almost $600 for our entire family. The only concession American was willing to make was to put us on a flight the next morning- which would mean we would have to pay for an extra night at our hotel, which was sold out. No refund or credit was given. We won’t be flying this airline ever again!   The crew on this flight was great!! They made sure everyone was comfortable and had a great flight. So friendly and personable. We met the crew prior to boarding. Great people with lovely personalities and outstanding service!   Please don\\'t fly on this airline. Unless you\\'re prepared to have a 5 to 6 hour delay and/or 2 to 3 gate changes. I wanted to have a relaxing weekend getaway after working with social services in my community but instead came home drained because of this American Airlines.  My family\\'s flight was canceled an hour before it was scheduled to take off. We were rerouted to an airport 90 minutes away from our final destination. At no point did American Airlines try to get us all the way home. They left us stranded at the airport with no way home other than to rent a car and pay out of pocket to drive home. When I asked for a reimbursement, they absolutely refused. They claimed they can\\'t reimburse people based on weather cancelations. I told them this wasn\\'t about the weather cancelation, it was about them stranding us at an airport 90 minutes away from our final destination and not reimbursing us for having to get ourselves all of the way home. I will never fly this airline again and, if you\\'re smart, you won\\'t either.   I experienced significant challenges with American Airlines following the cancellation of our flight from College Station to Buenos Aires on December 30, 2023. This cancellation prevented my wife and me from joining our family for a highly anticipated New Year\\'s Eve reunion, causing not only emotional distress but also financial losses due to non-refundable accommodations. In seeking compensation, our first response from American Airlines was the offer of a mere 2,500 bonus miles, a gesture that felt dismissively inadequate given the scale of our inconvenience and loss. Upon expressing our dissatisfaction and outlining the extent of our losses, including the missed family event and its emotional significance, American Airlines then proposed a marginally improved but still insufficient compensation of 17,500 miles. Our continued correspondence highlighted the disparity between our actual losses and the compensation offered, emphasizing that the financial and emotional impacts far exceeded what was being acknowledged. Despite our appeals for a fair and balanced compensation reflective of the full extent of our inconvenience and financial losses, the final counter offer received was a $300 credit. This amount represents only a fraction of the cost of the tickets. Accepting this credit did not equate to satisfaction with the resolution. It merely shows the extent to which American Airlines falls short of providing adequate care and compensation. Given this experience, we have resolved never to fly with this airline again unless faced with a life-or-death situation and no other carrier options are available.   What a terrible experience. We were kept on the plane for 4 hours before they eventually cancelled the whole flight. After that no one was any help and could not provide any refunds. I highly encourage everyone to never fly American Airlines.   Had a layover in Miami that was scheduled to leave @8:40pm. Was informed around 9pm that they were having staffing issues. @9:30pm we were informed that they have staff on the way and they should arrive in 20 minutes from Chicago - as they had some weather issues (completely understand). We then get informed that we have no pilot due to the airline overbooking his schedule (he went over on his hours and legally cannot fly a plane, completely understand). We then get informed we have a pilot and start boarding the plan at 11:20pm. We sat on the plane & tarmac until 12:40am, they then told us they couldn’t find another pilot and so our flight was cancelled. It is now currently 2am and we are still without our luggage (which has crucial personal medications on it). They refuse to give out meal / hotel vouchers as the flight was listed as cancelled due to “weather”. I am now watching children ages 0-18 sleeping on the floor of the airport. Also the American Airlines customer service is over a two hour wait. Staff was rude and not accommodating and told a young mother with two children to sleep on the airport floor.   Expect your flight to be changed 70% of the times. It\\'s a cheap airline and there\\'s a reason for it. You put your hard earned money to buy a plane ticket, you lock in a ticket in advance to have peace of mind, and they feel free to change it without notice whatsoever. I\\'ve made two round trips with this airline in the past year, and both return trips were changed by the airline. The second time, I didn\\'t even get an email! If you want unnecessary added stress to your trip, this is the airline for you  Was on the phone for 5 hours with the baggage claim number before I hung up. My baggage has been stuck on a plane of 2 days now and no one is able to tell me when it might be delivered to me. I was told my baggage would be delivered to an airport close to me two days ago and it’s at a total different airport. This is ridiculous. You expect me to hold on the phone for an entire day just to get a claim for my baggage.   Upon boarding the plane, the staff scanning my ticket told me my carry on was too big and to put it in the bag tryin. Fly with this bag regularly. My bag slid in with squishing my bag ever so slightly. She said it was too big because it touched the bar. So I took out my jacket out and that made the difference. I put my jacket back in my bag when I got on the plane and still had 3 inches of space above my bag. After an hour delay sitting on the plane due to a repair (understandably) the announcer comes over the intercom and says to the cabin “if the stewardess ask you to do anything don’t give them any trouble\" first time in 40 years I’ve heard such a lovely random comment. AA you need to have better customer service training for these rude people. Thanks for taking my money.   Apparently due to COVID-19 they are just stealing your money to stay afloat. I would think that they would want to keep your business. Listen we don\\'t want to cancel our trip, we just want to change dates but they\\'re trying to charge us more than what we paid for to begin with just to do that and if we cancel altogether we only get a voucher of $200 towards another flight. I thought airlines were ridiculous before Covid, now this is just absurd.   This was the worst experience I ever had at the airport. I missed my flight due to the negligence of the customer ice agent. When I complained about the service the agent was very disrespectful. I waited over an hour to see a manager. So I canceled my flight and booked with Delta. The experience with Delta was great. My company will never use this airline.   Initial 0730 flight delayed for mechanical issues. I was put on a flight leaving at 1:30, which I soon learned after departing would never make the connection in Dallas Fort Worth. Didn’t matter because my flight to Cincinnati was canceled. So I turned around and flew back to Portland. This flight was for a funeral occurring the next day which I missed. A funeral I was supposed to drive my mother to. This flight cost me $700. American Airlines offered me $125 credit. Never fly American Airlines they are the worst.  My son\\'s connecting flight got delayed by 2 hours not including the time he would already be layed over so I called and spoke to a man who was so helpful and very quick about it. I couldn\\'t be happier with their services. Don\\'t get me wrong, we always fly American as they have always been good to us but today went above and beyond to help us without any problems at all. Thank you American airlines.   Let\\'s start with the fact that we boarded the flight in Charlotte and then told the flight was canceled. No instructions on what to do. They gave our plane to the people going to Syracuse because their plane had mechanical problems. Finally I was told to go to airline services where the line was almost 100 yards long. I went to another terminal and they didn\\'t have any flights to Albany, NY. Now I have to spend the night in the airport because they won\\'t put me in a hotel for the night. Next flight is in the morning but I have to go to Washington DC and another 4 hour layover. While sitting here they boarded people onto a plane without interior lights only to make them get off again. Several flights had to switch gates so people are going every which way.  Absolutely no social distancing! I bought seats for a total of $120 to have our own row but American jammed people into every seat. Asked at the gate on one flight to be reseated and the gate agent said if I paid for another seat. Money hungry airline. So disappointed in lack of safety concerns.   This is the worst airline I have dealt with. 4 times in a row they have overbooked, canceled flights, or just not let certain people on. The first time the over booked the flight and made us miss a funeral, the second time they canceled the flight making us miss a cremation ceremony, this last time they only let half of the people on the plane making us miss our sons bootcamp graduation .... oddly enough the only people denied a seat were those going to the graduation. This last time was so bad we had to sleep in DFW overnight and they had to put us on a delta flight instead then canceled the return ticket while making us pay an extra $275 for a new flight. The staff was rude and disrespectful with one staff passively challenging my wife to fight him.   We were rerouted due to bad weather but were given no information. We had to stay all night in the airport without cots or blankets. Nothing was open during the night at the small Charlotte airport. Now I’m on the plane with no ac after waiting an hour and a half. Do better American!  Cost me a hotel and a rental car that I had to get and drive 600 miles after you FAILED to get us to our connecting flight and then had NO SOLUTION. My Phx-Dallas flight was delayed three hours, causing a missed connecting flight and I was informed that there were no other flights that I could take home, and none the next day either. We missed our connecting flight because of this - If you insist on delaying flights by THREE HOURS, at least have some kind of solution for the customers. That\\'s what professionals would do. I give credit to the aircrew, although they were late, they almost got us to Dallas in time to connect with the next flight, but then guess what? The airport ground crew decided they had no idea how to set up the Gate for passenger de-planing. Nice job!! Sat there for 45 minutes waiting on these staff who can\\'t even execute the basics. The basics! So we can\\'t even reasonably expect to de-plane the aircraft in less than 30 minutes anymore, and that is PATHETIC. Again, the aircrew did their part - they flew the plane - but still, three hours late, and the ground crew - complete FAIL. Airline industry, get your act together! Or you can count on losing more customers than you ever thought possible.  Phoenix to Philadelphia. Horrible airline. They cancelled our flight so we just got an earlier one and they would not allow us to bring on our luggage because we were too late getting to the gate and said our suitcases were too big, despite always using these same suitcases. They then told us we had to throw everything into a trash bag to use on carry on or to abandon our luggage. We ended up having to do the carry on option but they would not mail or ship our suitcases to us, even though it was AA’s screwup. They then had to take stuff from our carry on at security that was supposed to be in our suitcase like shampoo and sunscreen since we had to put everything in carry on. Losing a lot of money.   My wife and I were flying Barcelona to Kansas City via Philadelphia. (Flight 743, Scheduled for Oct 14) Our flight had mechanical issues and was delayed to the next day. (Oct 15) AA-BCN provided an excellent hotel for passengers and did an excellent service start to finish. Cudos for AA-BCN staff. We were to a finally arrived to MCI 2 days later after another provided hotel from AA in Philadelphia. While working with the AA-BCN staff, they informed the passengers that this cancellation / delay would fall EC 261 passenger rights, and definitely submit the documents. I have found the EC 261 form itself, but info has was evident on where to send the doc for processing. I have been working with AA support trying to get an answer. It \\'appears\\' that the AA support is most likely robo-responders. Response letters that do not say anything. I have not found any address or instructions on where to send the document (and any others) to get this into the AA system. Any ideas? The 2nd issue is about the complaint / concern with the far less than acceptable overnight accommodation in Philadelphia. The hotel in question is the Wyndham Garden Hotel. This is how AA takes care of international flyers? I have to believe than no customer support executives have stayed at this hotel. How does AA justify sending their flying customers to a 1 star hotel. Unbelievable, but that is AA\\'s hotel of choice. Does anyone work in AA customer support?   Avoid at all costs. Booked 11:20am flight from Sydney > Los Angeles > Dallas. 7pm the evening before I get an email to say my connecting flight from LA to Dallas has been booked at a later time because my Sydney to Los Angeles flight has been delayed. I logon to AA website and see estimated departure time has changed from 11:20am to 9:30pm, a delay of over 9 hours. I called as the booking still said 11:20am but estimated change to 930pm. As it is the night before the flight, obviously concerned about plans for the following day. The customer service representative assures me the flight has been delayed to 930pm and will not fly at 11:20am as scheduled. At this point the flight shows estimated departure 930pm and am assured by customer service it is now a 930pm departure which is why they also changed my flight from LAX to Dallas to a 9 hour later flight. I wake up in the morning and at 8am get a text to say my flight is now departing at 11:20am. As I required a PCR test before boarding there is obviously no chance of making this flight. I call customer service. They tell me the flight is 11:20am and that there was never any change more or less politely suggesting that I either made a mistake or am lying. I logon to my AA flight and it shows 11:20am, no reference to 930pm anywhere. Luckily, I still had the tab open in my browser and I can get a screenshot showing 930pm. After taking the screenshot, I refresh the browser and the 930pm reference disappears. The muppets at AA suggest a new booking. Now they want me to fly from Sydney to Melbourne, Melbourne to Los Angeles, Los Angeles to Dallas with between 4 and 6 hour stop overs at each destination (not to mention the 4 or 5 hours including PCR test at airport before the first flight). I say no, please book next direct flight to LA (next day). So they do.. and then half hour after booking a new email from AA \\'\\'your flight has been delayed and you may not make your connecting flight\\'\\'. Now going through exactly the same thing again. I am now phoning customer service requesting they book me with another airline (Qantas maybe?) that has some idea of how an airline. I understand times are difficult and unpredictable. The insulting part was suggesting that none of this ever happened and that my flight was always 11:20am and being absolutely unapologetic about their own incompetence. I would never fly or recommend this airline to anyone.   Flight was delayed several times, finally canceled flight after waiting all day. Been on hold with customer service for 2 hours, no one will answer. Been standing in line for hours, no customer service at all. They do not care about customers, can’t even get ahold of anyone to talk too. Everyone is rude, lost out on a day of work and have no idea where my bags are. Got stuck with a hotel bill for the night too. After dealing with this fiasco it cost me an $300 in food, room and I had to go buy some clothes. I understand things happen but they could at least cover the hotel room, and make themselves available to talk to. They truly do not care about you. Terrible company from the top down, management makes or breaks a company and they are breaking American. Eventually folks will just stop using them, I know I will.   American Airlines lost my bag and it is impossible to speak to a live agent to resolve the issue. I have been placed on hold several times for 2+ hours, only to have the agent transfer my call to be placed on hold for another 2+hours. They give the option to call back, but do not call back. I have been unable to contact them for four days. Avoid this airline. They are short staffed and it shows. Customer service is the worst.  I recently went to Austin, Texas for the AVMA 2024 convention June 21 to 25 th. I booked 1st class traveling from DC to Charlotte - Austin, flight was delayed, so missed the connecting flight, got to Austin the following day earlier AM, around 2 am. As if that was not bad enough, the return was even worse, left my hotel 5am flight to Chicago was delayed by 2 hours, got to Chicago my connecting flight was delayed too, so I should have been able to board my flight to DC, instead I was bumped off and other people on standby were allowed to board. AA made me wait at the airport for 16 hours before I was able to get home. I paid first class money just to suffer. I arrived home 2.30 am the following day and had to be at my Vet office to see clients at 9 am. I barely had 4 hrs of sleep! I am so done with AA, years ago they messed on my trip to Hawaii, I gave another chance and they blew. I am never traveling with again.   We board the aircraft at 6:55 for a flight that was supposed to depart at 7:38, stayed in for two hours (until 9:40 and were told to deplane, back to the gate we were constantly told that we would board and depart within the hour, that went on until midnight, then they delayed the flight to 5am. At 4:35 we boarded again only to stay inside of the aircraft for another 2 1/2 hours. It was a very bad experience that almost cost me my job since I was supposed to be at work by 6:30 in the morning. But the worse thing was the lies they told us over and over. Then they refused me to give me a refund for all that stress. It a very bad company and I don’t recommend it to anyone, actually there were other passengers that were saying that the same thing happened to them before with this same airline. And I’m only giving one star because the site won’t let me give 0  American Airlines hands down is the worst airline there is. I have had better experiences with Spirit Airlines and that’s a lot to say. They absolutely don’t care about their customers or their obligations. They will make you late to fill a plane and depart an hour after departing times with literally no concern for people’s connecting flights. If you complain to them you will be greeted with careless nonchalant concierges. Doors should’ve been closed to passengers 15 minutes before departure which is company policy, which I myself have been denied during entry before countless times having to rebook while the plane is still attached to the terminal with open seats because I was not within the 15 minutes! Well get this not once but twice in one trip the pilot was boarding passengers up to 20-30 minutes after departing time. The entire flight had to rebook connecting flights and cancel appointments made months ahead of time. They then blame it on weather conditions “along the route” which had nothing to do with why new passengers were being boarded on a full flight at 2.20pm when depart time was 1.45. This airline is a complete nightmare!   We had a $2500 vacation planned since April 2021. Scheduled to leave for Cozumel June 4th. Booked this vacation thru American Airlines. Flight was to leave June 4th at 9.16am. At 4.30am received a text message that the flight was cancelled. We have called and emailed several times to get a refund on our tickets. Not even so much as a return email or phone call. This was to be our first vacation together, not to mention the fact that we were in a wedding that we did not make it too. Leaving the wedding party out 2 people. I will never fly American again and I will not stop until I get a full refund amongst other things. You ruined my vacation that I had to save a long time for. Customer service needs a lot of work.   Omaha to Lihue via Los Angeles. American has lost any sight of customer service. It\\'s bad enough our flight was delayed, and once we were inflight and had to turn around for mechanical issues, they made no attempt to help customers get rebooked when we landed. The gate agent was the rudest, most inept person I\\'ve seen - and I fly a lot for business. I had to call American and had someone help me on the phone - he said I needed to return to gate agent to finish the rebooking, the agent screwed up and our luggage didn\\'t get switched. I specifically asked him to make sure he did a luggage transfer. As if that wasn\\'t bad enough, AA couldn\\'t locate our lost luggage the next day. We filed reports online, and our bags showed as at the Lihue airport; but they couldn\\'t find them. The lack of customer concern was astounding - we traveled to Hawaii from Nebraska and they had zero since of care or urgency. We called the AA lost baggage line and they said repeatedly the bags weren\\'t located. We finally went to airport again, went into the American baggage office and all the bags were just sitting there. We showed the clerk our luggage tags, assuming she\\'d want to check off her list that we took our luggage, but she wasn\\'t interested. Hours later, I received a phone call from AA luggage, asking for my claim numbers etc and to discuss our luggage. They didn\\'t want to use any process when we were standing there but wanted to interrupt my vacation to talk paperwork. I\\'m not surprised you are losing customers, getting low ratings etc. You should be embarrassed about how we were treated. \\xa0\\xa0I rarely feel the urge to write a review, however, as a family of 4 travelling from the UK to Belize via the US over Christmas, I felt I had to inform others of the exceptionally poor service American Airlines provides. In total we had 4 flights with the airline, my main gripe refers to our flight from Miami to Belize which should have only been a 90 minute flight but was delayed for 9 hours. Firstly the previous crew had highlighted an electrical issue with our plane but we boarded relatively on time, only to taxi to the runway, do an about turn back to the stand as the fault had reoccurred. After sitting on the tarmac for about 40 minutes we were sent back to the terminal to await further news. The issue couldn\\'t be fixed quickly so we awaited a replacement plane, which we subsequently found out had un resolved maintenance issues, time passed and we awaited a 3rd plane - again with issues, but which they could fix in a reasonable time. Several hours had passed at this point. The Pilot\\'s working hours had then expired to we had to wait for another pilot, again 2 attempts to find a pilot, then the first officer\\'s hours expired, again await another first officer. 9hrs later we finally left Miami, missed a day of our holiday, had to pay extra transport costs due to the very late arrival of the plane. The end result being a paltry $50 credit with the airline that I will never be flying with again. On the outbound UK flight some of the crew were rude - having been asked if headphones came in child sizes by another passenger I overhead a crew member walk away sniggering saying who does he think we are Target! They ran out of meat meals and thrust veggie options at us, with a \\'tough this is all we have left\\' attitude. On the inbound flight having had to wait 20 minutes for wine with my meal that had long been eaten I was virtually thrown a bottle - with no glass to drink it with. We are seasoned travellers and I\\'ve never experienced such appalling service and from a well established airline I certainly didn\\'t expect it. Needless to say I won\\'t ever be flying with them again. It has also put me off travelling via the US in future.  I have been flying American Airlines for more than 25 years. On my recent trip from Charlotte to Portland, there was no food offered for a 5.5 hour flight. There was no in-flight entertainment devices offered. I was required to use my own cell phone. One hour into the flight, the beverage cart came around. It did not come around again until almost an hour before landing. Beverage selection was very limited, if any, I become more and more disappointed with American Airlines. Although I have been a loyal customer, I will be choosing alternative airlines in the future. I am done with the lack of customer service at American Airlines.   I don\\'t often complain, however, I\\'ve noticed a trend with American Airlines always delayed, canceled or changes. I\\'ve purchased our tickets months ago only to be downgraded to a class that I\\'ve worked hard to pay for. I understand there are other customers in worse situations, however if it had only been a one time thing, I would\\'ve not bothered but I\\'ve tried a few more times after and have been completely disappointed. My fault for expecting to get what I pay for with this airline. This will most certainly be the last time we give our business to American Airlines. Disappointed.   This review isn’t about me personally but we had to go through the worst thing last night. My family and I went to pick up my grandfather last night, he was flying up from Miami, to Baltimore MD. His flight arrived at 11:50pm and he was never properly taken to us. He should’ve been brought to us with an assistant. Nobody called us informing us about Him which we were supposed to receive a call. We were at the airport until 2:30am waiting around hoping someone could give us answers as to where he was or where he was dropped off. We were at the gates since 11pm. We were roaming around the whole airport asking everyone for help and everyone there was useless. We eventually went home and didn’t get a phone call until 4am, my grandfather was outside in the cold, alone. He got his passport stolen his ID and wallet stolen. He is 87 years old unable to defend himself. This is unacceptable. You bet we will never be flying with American again.   We will never fly American Airlines again. First of all we have always had problems with this company to begin with as every time we have flown American they have always delayed our flights, Our last flight with them returning from Cancun was delayed 6 hours without compensation. Ruined our return to work the following day. The real reason and issue we Will never fly with them again was our recent flight due on Dec 2. It was cancelled on us 11/30 (less than 48 hours before) with a mere email and excuses from both the representatives and supervisor I spoke with who were exceptionally rude. I asked to take the same flight they cancelled on me which was available for same price and was told it was not their problem. Really horrible treatment and ruined our trip just 2 days before. We are two physicians who fly all the time for business, pleasure, and fun. We always offer to assist or help on flights whenever we travel if needed. To be treated this way is so unacceptable and unprofessional for such a \"large\" company.  Contrary to many reviews here I had a very good experience despite “Covid” cutbacks a Premium experience was delivered. A decent meal plus a continental breakfast before landing was served by a very gracious crew. The seat and amenities were very good. Of course no welcome drink and disposable cups are a deficit and no one believes the Covid excuse anymore but in general a very positive experience.  Our flight was really messed up due to my husband not knowing how to work computers. The attendants at the service desk (Sandy, Sarah and Gwen) had the patience of an angel. They took their time to fix the problem, to make sure we got our refund back. And they also made sure that they got us on the next flight out tomorrow with seats sitting next to each other. Due to me mentioning that I’m afraid to fly. These woman were very kind, had so much patience and very understanding with the lack of our knowledge with computers. American Airlines is lucky to have them. It wasn’t an easy fix but they joked and laughed with us and before we knew it our flights were rescheduled the next day. They are role models for the service industry.  Destin to Dallas. We are traveling with 3 small kids under 7 years old. We booked the tickets in advance with paid assignment seats so that we can sit together and manage them. When we showed up at VPS, they provided 3 seats for that children 3 rows away from us. We asked the front desk check in clerk to do something about it, she said she couldn’t do anything for her. She asked us to go up to the boarding gate to talk to the agent, which we did. But the agent at the boarding gate told us that the same thing - asked us to call 1-800-843-3447, which we did. The 1-800 # customer service told us there is nothing she can do on her end, and told us to go to the agent at the boarding gate to resolve this issue. I told her that we spoke to everyone AA staff at VPS but no one has a solution for us. The conversation did not go anywhere. We got screwed with our paid assignment seats which in turn separate the separate the children from us and prevented us sitting together as a family.  Worst airline experience I have ever had to deal with. I was on standby with my fiancé. They called us and told us they only had one seat left so we had to decline, minutes later they opened up seating for a family of 5 and we could no longer get on because they passed us by since we “declined”. The workers do not seem to know what they are doing either. If you want a stress free flight, choose Southwest. I have flown with them a bunch and they always have been good!   First of all, the CDC recommends me to not wear a mask due to previous breathing problems. Secondly, I was polite and put on the mask anyway. The flight attendant sees its not over my nose and tells me I have to put it on. I calmly explain I have breathing problems. He didn\\'t give one care. 15 minutes later I see the same flight attendant with his mask completely off. Not eating, not drinking. Just being a complete hypocrite. I refuse to fly American Airlines ever again and I\\'ve flown over 15,000 miles with them. Not anymore!   The worst airline ever. I traveled with this airline for three time and each time they had one connecting flight cancelled. Very poor management. In my flight on June 9 2022 i was in Miami airport and the airline changed boarding gates for three times and delayed and changed boarding time for three times. I finally missed my second connecting flight to Toronto at 9.30pm. They the booked for me for the next day at 8.30 in the morning. Finally I stayed overnight in new York. It was a terrible experience. I will never travel with this airline anymore.   I had a flight schedule to see family in Illinois, and overnight prior to the flight, I received an email the flight was cancelled and rescheduled(for 2 days later). I called in and was advised a credit would be applied. I asked for a supervisor and demanded a refund, not a credit. I was advised this would be processed, and I would receive and email to document this. It has been 8 days. No email, and no refund on my credit card. I have sent 2 emails thru the AA website. I have received to automated responses, but nothing else. I have called in several times(huge wait times. Have spoken with 2 customer services reps, that show it is in process. I understand the airlines are having a hard go with many unspoken issues, but come on. As I said to all of the cust serv reps, this is not my fault. This is totally on American Airlines. They blame this on weather issues, but you read about their personnel issues, and the Southwest Airlines pilot walkout, as a consumer you really wonder. Anyway, I am done venting. If anyone from American Airlines sees this, please HELP!  Absolutely THE WORST airline. The bathrooms on the plane were filthy and not cleaned by flight attendants prior to passengers boarding the plane. There was faeces smeared all over one bathroom and the other had some kind of seeds or sand that broke all over it. There was no first aid kit on the plane. My finger got injured and was beeding. I was only given 2 bandaids and was told to wash it out with water from the dirty bathroom. The flight attendants forgot I was washing my finger and blocked the bathroom doors, I almost did not make it to my seat prior to take off, this shows how careless the flight crew was. The flight attendants did not properly do their jobs, they allowed the passengers to store small handbags and mini backpacks in the overhead compartment and also stored their own luggage, which occupied all the space and half of the passengers had to have their carry on luggage checked. My genuine leather, expensive bag got ruined and they refused to cover the cost. The service on the plane was horrible and there were no TV screens. I will never fly this airline again!  Easy check in. Easy and fast and civilized boarding. Very pleasant and accommodating inflight crew. Just a pleasant and stress free experience. We always choose AA on this route and have never been disappointed. On a side note: Looks to me that compared to 2023 the food presented in business class on this route has improved markedly.  American Airlines is a horrible airline and I would not recommend them to anyone! I rank them - 0 if that is possible My daughter came to visit me from North Carolina coming to Alaksa. I had no choice but to use this airline as no other airline in North Carolina came to Alaska. Her children are 2 and 5 months and her husband was unable to come due to work. When she and her family got to American Airlines in North Carolina they where greeted with horrible customer service. She had 2 carry ons, diaper bag , the toddlers back pack , stroller, car seat and many other things to carry alone. She could not check the carry ons and car seat until the gate. She asked for her husband to have a pass to come back and it was a real struggle and fight but finally after causing much stress they let him back. Upon her arrival American Airlines caused me much stress but finally let me back to help her today 08/29/2020 was the worst service by far. They see she has all these things and could not check them in until the gate and totally refused to let me go help her or let any of their team members help her back. She was so stressed and crying, TSA security was so surprised at their lack of service and that they refused to let me back. They took one of their workers to walk her to the gate. I am totally shocked at their lack of help, understanding, common courtesy and respect.   False weather cancelation. Several weeks out, our flight was changed from our originally scheduled travel times which threw the first wrench into our plans. The night before our 8am flight, we received notice that the first leg of our trip was delayed which would cause us to miss our connection. In the middle of the night, we received notice that our flight was canceled, with no alternative provided. We called AA and after waiting on hold for over an hour at 2am, we were told we’d have to contact our travel agent (booked through Chase bank) or pay $50. After several hours on hold and dropped calls, we were told the cancelation was due to weather, however, no other flights were canceled in either airports along the two legs. We were also told our flight did not quality for refund. At that point, we were on the hook to pay for a substitute flight and last minute flights were 5x what we paid. Horrible experience and ruined trip. I will never fly AA again.  Miami to Las Vegas. The only good thing I have to say is that the planes are very comfortable. But that’s all. My husband and I had our return flight home to Las Vegas booked out of Miami for 6/10 at approximately 6:30pm. Our flight was delayed due to “maintenance” repeatedly every 30-45 mins from 5:30p until 8:30p. Then they reassigned our plane and gate and updated us to a 9:40pm departure. We were given very minimal information during this time. Finally at 11pm, they advised us that they no longer had a pilot and would be cancelling the flight. They sent us to the rebooking counter, which had a two hour wait to be helped. When we finally got to the counter at 1am, almost every flight to get us home was already booked because, as our gate attendant advised us, we waited too long to adjust our flights. We requested compensation and we’re not offered any. Instead they directed us to email customer service (which we did and received an automated response for a 7-10 business day or longer response during peak travel times). The gate “manager” offered us two $12 meal vouchers for the ADDITIONAL DAY of travel - one of which did not work when we went to use it. Finally, we inquired about a hotel for the evening, but they were “sold out” because we (once again) “waited too long.” We were offered to book our own room and receive a $150 reimbursement - good luck finding a hotel room in Miami at 1am on a Friday for that price! My husband and I were able to rebook our flights - but all the nonstop were unavailable (which was what we originally booked to get home to our two children - 2.5 and 8months) - so they gave us a ticket which included a 7 hour layover. At every turn no employee was interested in making it right. They were rude. Unhelpful. They acted as if we created the problem and should find our own solution. This was just unacceptable. Period.   Ruined my trip with delays. Then 3 weeks ago I canceled a flight a month in advance and was told that I wasn\\'t getting a refund or anything back. When I tried I was hung up on 3 times. I\\'ve never been disrespected this badly by any company. Worst customer service ever   Flew first class to Puerto Rico, hopped over to St Croix and returned. Sadly I have flyer miles with American, what can I say, from the first class lounge at JFK to every aspect of the flights American Airlines is the worst. Totally, completely the worst.   I fly first class with American Airlines at a minimum once a month and or pay for my Chief Operations Officer to fly first class. I politely asked the Stewardess to turn the air down because I was hot and I heard coach passengers requesting for the air to be turned up. I’ve never complained once before but if I’m paying for first class my request should be treated with respect. This flight attendant is less than 100lbs and I understand but it’s a 6 hour flight. Lastly, when boarding the plane only one entrance way was open so it didn’t matter if you purchased first class or not.   What an atrocity of an airline. The flight was delayed, they then took us to the different airport and would not let anyone de-plane. We then flew to the correct airport. And then it took over an hour for them to pull up to a gate and let us off. Poor customer service, we all missed our connecting flights and no one from American seemed to care. I had to call their 800 number to rebook my connecting flight and wait on hold. For a company that preaches about their customer service, I have had too many pathetic experiences with American. They should be downright ashamed of the \"business\" they run.  American Airlines will either get you sick by packing the plane to it’s gills during a pandemic, or they will ruin your trip with delays and rescheduling. Or they may just do both. Such a garbage airline and I won’t use them again. They should be forced to add flights during a pandemic or shut down. Not make maximum cash by loading the plane elbow to elbow. They should honestly be ashamed of their customer service. Do yourself a huge favor and use an alternate airline.  Unreliable, never runs on time, they don’t reimburse for lost time or money. Customer service is inept and full of excuses. This airline is getting worse every time, they don’t value their customers   When I arrived in Dallas, I went to boarding counter and informed them, I had just passed a kidney stone. They told me to go to customer service which was 15 min walk and my plane was boarding in 20 min and I had just passed a stone. However, I went to customer service and staff called me over. I informed him, i had just passed a stone and if he could allow me to take a flight to Orlando in the next 24 to 72hrs instead of boarding now, so i can rest and go to hospital. He says it will cost me a hundred dollars. I said you do this flight almost daily and I am just asking for a the same seat or any seat and to fly out at same time or anytime you deem okay. He than tells me, I should of called reservations and he doesn\\'t have time to deal with this, his only job is to help customers that have had their flights cancelled. He than calls 1800 number and infront of me, makes it a point to ask the agent on the other end. So, the customer should call you correct? He should not come to my desk with this correct?  I decided to walk away and when I went to boarding my seat was deleted and I had to wait an extra 5 min for the boarding agent to give me a different seat.   American Airlines is dishonest. I purchased a first class ticket from Denver to Savannah- one stop in Charlotte. Getting there, while hardly a first class experience was adequate. The return flight was another story. American booked the connection from Savannah to Charlotte too close to the Denver connection, and due to their known incompetence, sat on the tarmac while my flight to Denver left. The next flight was a 3.5 hour wait in a jammed airport, and the extremely rude customer service agent informed me that there were no 1st class seats to accomodate the Denver route (longest leg of the flight). So, not only did they overbook, but they were unwilling to work on getting me the seat I had paid for, a month before the trip. The only seats left were middle row rear. Incompetent. The first class round trip ticket was $683. l was refunded a total of $110. for the error on their part- this was for the downgrade only. Now, l\\'m not a genuis, but 110. for the longest leg is absurd- the American Eagle rattletrap that got us from Savannah to Charlotte offered a bag of chips and, if desired, a drink- that\\'s their \"first class\". Due to utter incompetence, avoid flying American.   I will never fly with American Airlines again. They closed boarding early and would not let me on the plane. They told me that 200 other people heard over the PA that they were closing boarding early and that I should have been paying attention. They booked me on the next flight but refused to print out a boarding pass for me so I had to go back to ticketing and through TSA again. I was booked as an economy passenger despite paying for a first class ticket and the flight had first class seats available. Horrible customer service and you can’t rely on their policies.   I just flew with the kindest attendant I\\'ve ever met. I fly a lot for work and have never met a kinder flight attendant. Her name was Donna from the Austin to Charlotte route. She helped a family from another country that did not speak English. She ensured they were able to get to their next flight and made sure they had snacks and drinks for their next flight since it was short and not providing drink services. She was amazing.   Everything from check in thru security to boarding went very smoothly. In flight services were very good. Seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment operated perfectly. This was an afternoon flight so there were only 2 selections for lunch. Both were cold plates but they were tasty and plentiful. Overall, my experience was very good. It was about a 2 1/2 hour flight and it went quickly. Cabin crew was very attentive to all passengers in my section of the plane.   I stopped flying AA over 15 years ago because everything I did, which was a lot, planes never on time, planes dirty, rude flight attendants and terrible snack/food choices. So after 15 years I decided to try again. Worst mistake ever. Same issues. I understand planes can be late, but unacceptable when your watching the plane sitting outside for over 1 hour and they say they are cleaning plane. Flight attendants are seen just hanging out next to captain, chatting it up. Connecting flight was suppose to leave at 8 pm. By the time we left it was midnight. And again, rude FA\\'s, dirty plane (thought they were cleaning for an hour at least). Never ever again.   American airlines delayed our flight 5 times in a matter of hours due to personnel issues. This caused us to miss our connecting flight. They wanted to rebook us on a flight 2 days later. It took me 6 hours to get an answer as to why this was happening and find a new way home which was $2000. When I emailed customer relations (no one would speak on the phone) they offered me a $25 travel credit. This doesn\\'t even cover 1 ticket. I don\\'t recommend American airlines.   When I arrived in Houston, I was sent an email stating that my Bag did not make it on the plane with me. It stated that my Bag would be delivered to me within 4 hours. This was on Saturday, May 20 at 12pm. It is now Sunday, May 21st at 7:21. I was given a website to click on, which I did. I completed the form within 30 minutes. I put the address where I would be staying while visiting my son. I kept checking the website which informed me that my Bag would be delivered on Saturday. It was not. On Sunday morning at 9:30, the website stated my Bag was picked up at 8:23am and would definitely be delivered by 6pm. It was not. I have medication in my bag that is supposed to be taken daily. I don\\'t have any clothes or personal items. I have searched and searched for a phone number to call or an email to send, so I could notify customer service of my predicament. I could not find any way to message someone, only mire forms to complete. I have been in Galveston which I stated on the first form I sent. Tomorrow, I will be returning to Houston and will be going to the Airport to talk to a real person who can hopefully help me. I will never fly American Airlines again. I can understand that things happen, but not communicating with me or providing me with a way to communicate with a live person is inexcusable.   A 1 hr flight that was meant to depart at 4:30 led me to waste my whole day because of some mismanagement. They delayed the flight several times beforehand eventually cancelling it later on there was no proper communication to the customers and absolute ignorance towards us. Also they didn’t provide us any compensation in terms of financial compensation or providing a lounge as we were delayed for over 5 hrs eventually cancelling the flight. Worst experience ever will not recommend to anyone literally wasted my whole day cause of their mismanagement.   American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown with. I will never, every fly with them again. My most recent trip was a nightmare. First, our flight was cancelled and this didn’t notify us. We waited to check-in and check our bags for over 2 hours before we found out our flight was cancelled. They managed to get us on another flight, but then we sat in the plain without moving for 2 hours. Apparently, they didn’t know how to weigh the plane. At least, that’s the excuse they gave when they started making the flight attendants count the passengers, and that was after an hour and half of sitting there with no news. Because of that delay, we missed our connecting flight to Japan. We waiting over 2 hours in line for help and would have waiting longer had I not flagged down a random employee and begged for help. They were able to put us on a different route, adding over 12 hours to our trip. To top it off, they lost our baggage. Our baggage sat in the USA for 3 days before they found it and sent it to us. They are the most incompetent, ignorant, sloppy airline I have ever encountered and will now go to great lengths to avoid.   It is impossible to book baggage on this route until you check in, never ever had this problem with any other airline. I found the baggage information online to be quite misleading and confusing. I approached ground staff the evening before my flight as I was staying at the hotel located in Miami airport, they were rude and unhelpful. They were not interested in helping me. The following day the check in agent was helpful and did a good job in assisting me. Ultimately I won’t fly AA again as there are far better airlines out there.   Sent my kids-first time flying alone- first class from RI to NC last yr. AA delayed their flight 3x over 7hrs before putting them on a diff flight, separated, in middle seats. Fine..it happens. After a yr of calling (3 or 4x), I gave up getting the 2k back we lost on downgrade not to mention compensation for a 7hr delay. Fast forward this yr and my wife, kids and I have flown 12 times (American) between us in the last 6 months because our airport is their hub and not many options exist at reasonable times outside AA. Not once!! Have any of us flown without a significant delay. Always mechanical issues, staff and more recently “ghost” weather issues. Last night was the final straw. We flew from Palm Beach to Charlotte (90 min flight). We arrived at 11am for a 1:40 flight, checked in one bag and relaxed a bit. Notified instantly there was a 30min delay. Ok…20 mins later, 30 more min delay. 15 min later, 45 more min delay. Zero counter agents present to talk to. Called main number: mechanical. Ok. 2 other AA flights nxt to us also delayed an hr at a time for 7hrs. Also supposedly mechanical issues.  By 4pm I called a 3rd time and agent said “listen, not sure this flight is makn it to u but I can put u on a 7:20 direct. There are 15 seats left so I suggest u take them now”. I said fine. We were beat but we needed to be home for work in morning. Meanwhile, both flights next door kept getting pushed back as well. Anyway, we waited. Around 6pm we were notified 30min delay. Weather?! I checked: Phily to Palm Beach flight - 2% precipitation, 2mph winds, 81 degrees, sunny and clear inside 150mile radius of the Phily flight being delayed for weather. Zero weather issues between Phily and Palm Beach. 20mins later, another hr delay. 8:45 departure time now and we’ve been here since 11am. A counter agent showed up, I asked what was going on? He said they use “weather” to avoid having to compensate and when the phone agent “guided” me to take another flight, I lost all compensation from earlier mechanical delays and that they’re trained to do this with zero regard for customer satisfaction. Meanwhile the other flights next to us continued to be delayed an hr at a time until 11pm departures. I don\\'t know what has changed since covid, but this airline has zero regard for it’s customers. They’re deceptive and unethical. They don\\'t care about anything other than they’re bottom dollar and they do everything possible to avoid compensation for horrendous service. Furthermore, they’ve jacked the prices up so high that it cost us 800 ea to fly economy from Fla to Nc. I can fly to Paris round trip for half of that on other airlines. They never ever give u the truth about these delays and stall in 30min increments even though they’re fully aware of the final outcome. I cherish the day that this nxt generation uses all it’s platforms to blacklist these airlines out of business or at least force them to focus on quality vs profit. We arrived at 10:20. Sat on tarmac for 30min and spent an hr waiting for our luggage that never arrived.   San Francisco to Buenos Aires via New York. Can\\'t fault American Airlines, I seem to have good luck with them. All flights departed and arrived on time. All pre-selected seats honored. All luggage arrived to destination. Ground staff and cabin crew were all just fine. The A321 from SFO to JFK was a good plane. Had really bad clear weather turbulence, boarding on violent for about 2 hours that the pilot struggled with and did his best. Then ran into a heavy storm on the east coast and had to circle around a few times over the ocean before being able to land at JFK, but the pilot kept us informed. Landed at JFK and made it quickly over to the gate to catch our flight to Buenos Aires. Took off in the pouring rain right back into the storm we just got out of and had a few more hours of turbulence before the flight settled down. Food and drink service was standard economy meals and snacks with multiple beverages runs made. Made it to Burenos Aires, cleared customs and baggage arrived promptly. Only positive things to say on this journey.   I recently flew round trip from Toronto to New Zealand and the flight attendants were awful. They barely welcomed us on board. I have a broken collar bone and could not find any FA in sight. I had a sling on and explained my medical condition when I finally found one. I asked for assistance putting my bag in the overhead, I was told on 3 flights they were too busy. On the 4th flight the FA told me if I couldn\\'t lift it, she couldn\\'t either. Luckily there were very kind passengers around who heard this and helped me on each flight. I sent an email to American, their response was \"sorry you had an inconvenience on our flight, we look forward to welcoming you on board soon\".   Decent on time experience. Rushed but polite service. Ample, decent but cold breakfast. Everything good by today’s lower standards. Covid is now about cost cutting rather than safety. It should be acknowledged.   I had a two hour delay in Atlanta that caused me to miss my connecting flight to Virginia. I then had a 3 hour layover in North Carolina, once it was finally time to get on my next flight it was delayed 15-30 mins. I finally got on my flight to Virginia and once I landed I went to get my bag. They lost it in transit. I spoke to a gentlemen at American Airline baggage claim and he told me he needed a baggage ticket, I informed him I never received one. He then told me well you should have. Then he said he has know clue where the bag is, come to find out it was in the airport and now I have to wait for the next day in order to get my bag.   Terrible experience. I was stranded in Washington Reagan airport for 12hrs on my way to Toronto from Chicago because the 1st flight was delayed and the worst is I was made to sleep in the airport because they said they don\\'t have hotel voucher. And I almost missed the next flight because they switched gate numbers 3 times in a matter of 2hrs. Had I not checked the boarding pass online every now and then I could have been delayed further. I will never use this airline again and I recommend others to do the same.   AA advertised extreme latitude in editing, changing, or canceling tickets amidst the health situation going on in the US. I went to change the backside of my ticket and approximately 45 days prior to the flight and they were staunch about not editing anything and were not helpful at all regarding any options. I would not recommend them to anyone who needs any sort of flexibility or who wants customer service that actually cares about your situation.   Terrible. Changes the departure time 9 times and the gate assignment changes 5 times. At the time of this writing the flight is 14 hours delayed. I doubt it will actually leave. Their staff has been rude at times too. Don’t fly American.   I will never travel American Airlines again. They lost my suitcase, never found it, and are not giving me any kind of reimbursement because I don’t have receipts for the items that were in my suitcase. They expect me to save receipts for every item I purchase over the last 5 years. They are also refusing to reimburse me for the items purchased on my trip. They state they only reimburse items purchased on my trip if they locate my bag. If they don’t locate my bag, they will give me just the claim amount for what’s in my suitcase, but you have to have receipts for them to give you any kind of claim amount back. So I got nothing back. Awful. Never again.   It is unacceptable for an airline to cancel a flight due to \\'lack of crew\\' to fly passengers. American Airlines did just that today 7/27/2021 for flight number AA315 out of Philadelphia which was scheduled to depart for Miami at 5pm. My husband and I had booked this flight on our way to Dominican Republic for a vacation. This flight was delayed from 5pm to 5:30pm (not so bad, right?), to 6pm and then to 6:40pm. At this point all passengers boarded the plane and sat at their respective seats by 6:40 - 6:45pm. As we sat on the plane, the flight was again delayed to 7:15pm. There were absolutely no updates to the passengers from the crew as to the cause of the delays! We were just getting text messages from AA. So we patiently waited .. 7:00pm .. 7:05pm .. 7:15pm .. Nothing. No movement, the plane was still sitting at the gate. Then between 7:27pm and 7:28pm (we\\'re still in the plane), the flight was pushed out to 2:00am .. 6:00am and then finally to 8:30am the following day 7/28/2021. At this point, the captain announced that the plane had been grounded! Shortly thereafter, all passengers de-planed and we headed to customer service to make alternate plans. This is when we learned from one of American Airlines\\' customer service reps that the cause of the delay was due to lack of crew members to fly the plane. Unbelievable! This is the least that anyone would expect from such a reputable airline. And needless to say, our long awaited vacation (since pre- Covid-19) has been ruined! We\\'re on standby with no guarantees. All because American Airlines was short handed! It\\'s a disgrace!   This was my first time flying American Airlines after flying with multiple other airlines and these were hands down the worst flights I’ve been on. The second flight had some poor weather and I’d never experienced that before but the first one was also horrible and the worst landing I’ve had. The customer service was okay, but if I had to choose having good customer service and having a good flight, I think I’d go with the latter of the two.   What was supposed 2 be a 2hr flight turned Into being a 7hr Flight! They put my bah on a different plane. My plane got here at 11pm, I had 2 Wait Until 11:45pm for my Bag to get off the next plane, with two toddlers.  American will never earn my business again.   Beware you are not going to get what you expect. Took a flight from TX to Charlotte. Awful experience. As the misery grew on my overnight layover so did the displeasure. People lying all over the airport due to miss connections. I saw a family of 8 sleeping on the floor due to flights delays and all American agents had to offer was I\\'m sorry. No empathy at all. Trailer at your own risk.   The flight departed and had to return to Buenos Aires because of mechanicals problems. They left us at the airport all night and the counter was supposed to open at 6am , so we were waiting all night and it is 7:30 am and nobody is here to fix the problem. Next flight is at 8 pm so i will be in the airport for more than 24 hours, the company asked us to go to a hotel, i don\\'t have money because my daughter will take care of me as soon as i arrive to USA. American Airlines is doing nothing to fix the problem. This is the last time i use this company.   Well the flight was nice. But when I went to retrieve my luggage, the young lady informed me that my bag was on the next flight coming from Miami to Washington. I asked her why and she said she does not know why, they never tell her that. I had to wait 3 hours for my bag to arrive. I left the airport and then returned, thank God my bag was there. My husband and son’s bag came with our flight but mine did not.  La Guardia to Charlotte. Flight 628 at 6am Sunday morning July 10 2022. The people in LGA airport are the most obnoxious and rude people I have ever seen. You would think they would be courteous and smile and be respectful so people would want to go back. Then one flight attendant was even worse. I don\\'t usually fly and she stood there staring at me and I didn\\'t know why she put her hand on her hip and screamed at me what do you want to drink so I asked what do you have she turned to to me and asked what do you want so I asked for ice tea and she gave me an attitude - we dont have that we have water, soda or hot tea. She gave us water after that she came to pick it all up and grabbed the cups out of our hand. She should not be someone who works with people at all - very disappointed. I would have to really think about next time taking American airlines. Then again the flight home was perfect people and flight attendants were amazing flight 2031 July 15 2022 950pm.   American Airlines did have a major flight delay/cancellation issue that caused me some problems on my trip. However, I was able to contact customer service and they refunded my costs and then some. I\\'m very pleased with how reasonable they responded to the situation and will be using their services again in the future.   The worst airline to fly through. They will give your seat away - we had an emergency and weren\\'t able to check in an hour before. We watched people check in for our flight while we waited an 4 hours for the next flight.   The flight kept delayed from 4 pm till midnight, in top of that at the last minute they decide to change the gate to another one that was 15 min walk just to announce to us delay the flight to next morning! I lost one full day of my vacation at the airport. when I finally fly and transit through LAX, the transit was so long not like my original flight, so AA gave me a stay voucher but at 2 am my family and I found that the hotel is overbooked and there is no room left. What a great start to a family vacation. We booked the nearest hotel which was an overpriced trashy level hotel and paid out of pocket for the hotel stay and all taxi trips back and forth between hotels and the airport. After taking a totally different flight on different dates to my final distention we found that our luggage is still in LAX and won’t arrive at least until the next day. I complained with proof of documents and bills to AA to at least pay me back my hotel stay and taxi trips since my original flights had a short time wait and we wouldn’t pay any extras if it was on time but they do not care about customers and the airline\\'s image as well. I beg everyone who would like to enjoy their vacation and get treated fairly for what they pay to avoid booking with AA.   American Airlines had everyone board the plane and then kept us there unable to take off for over an hour. This caused my wife and I and most others on the plane to miss our connecting flight in Chicago. Thanks to American airlines my quick 2 hours of flying has turned into waiting for 10 hours in Chicago for another flight. Never flying American Airlines again, ever.   This is about American\\'s website and changes. We booked over a 3 months ago, they changed our flight a month later, then the night before they cancelled our flight. We were given a new flight, losing a day. When we tried to check-in online they said our Covid requirements have not been met. Everything has been verified with Verifly and I have the app that shows we are ready to fly; however, the American Airlines website said we cannot check in online because we need to download the app. I have the app, everything is done but you can not get through when you try and call, no matter what, you are disconnected by their automated service. We haven\\'t flown yet so I\\'m giving them 3 stars for service and seat comfort. I will never fly American Airlines again - this will be my first and only experience with American, guaranteed!   AA is the worst airline ever. Don’t know how they still exist. We paid extra $20 per seat so we can get assigned seats and sit all together as a family. 24hrs prior to the flight, I checked in and realized that they move all 4 of us to different seats and we are not sitting together. I was on hold for almost 2 hours to speak to a manager. The manager told me “the seats are not guaranteed”. Oh hello, why would I want to pay $20 extra per person x 4 people, $80 to get no guaranteed seats. This will be the first and last time flying with AA. Customer service sucks!   Worst airline ever. Both flights got delayed, baggage took forever to come and besides that it was damaged. I\\'ll never fly American again. Waste of time and money.    Flight from Los Angeles to London. The space for your legs and general movement is on par with a cheap domestic flight! A 14-hour journey in these conditions is torture, not pleasure! Flug von Los Angeles nach London. Der Platz für die Beine und allgemein für die Bewegung liegt auf dem Niveau eines günstigen Inlandsfluges! Eine 14-stündige Fahrt unter diesen Bedingungen ist eine Qual und kein Vergnügen!   This is my second review for the same trip. Flew Raleigh to Miami, ordered a vodka drink at no charge, the next flight Miami to Lima, ordered a vodka drink and the stewardess says we charge. I said they didn\\'t for the Raleigh to Miami trip, her excuse was very rude and that we charge for trip to lima . Have to say American airlines customer service sucks will be canceling my advantage card and never travel with American Airlines again.    Rebooked my flight from Lubbock to Dallas stranding me in Dallas overnight. Fargo has very few flights from Dallas, which is why I was flying in the afternoon. Unwilling to provide accommodations for me. Awful experience. Would not recommend.   My son was flying from CAE to CLT to ALB. His flight was delayed from CAE to CLT for 3 hrs. By the time he landed in CLT, he and 10 others had missed their connection. He was finally told that AA was flying him back to CAE and they would reschedule him tomorrow or on Saturday. He was in terminal B in CLT and had 12 minutes to get over to terminal E. He was told to run in order to make his new flight. He made it to the flight just in time and was told that by taking the flight back to CAE his ticket would be complete and he would then need to purchase a new ticket to get to ALB. Now my wife, at 10:45pm, has to drive 1 1/2 hours to CLT to pick up my 23 year old son. Then they will drive 1 1/2 hrs back home, arriving around 3am if they are lucky. My wife has work at 8am tomorrow. American Airlines is no help.   AA canceled my flight at 2am same day I was supposed to fly out. So after I get through from a 4 hour hold time, they switched me from a departure at Dallas instead of Austin. Meaning I had to drive 2.5 hours to get to my new flight. Just snacks were served in the 7.5 hour flight. Coming back was a different airline so we returned to Austin and because AA changed the flight, I had to find a ride home from Austin to my home 1 hour away, find a ride to Dallas to pick up my vehicle which means days accrued at the parking garage; money lost for mileage along with the inconvenience. Not once did they Apologize and I have yet to hear back from customer relations. No compensation offered, seats were hard, minimal movies to watch. Glad i wasn\\'t diabetic because all they gave out were sweet or salty snacks! We were supposed to have wifi and that was NOT accurate.   In March 2020, we were planning a tour of Ireland and then going on to Scotland via American Airlines. Suitcases were packed and we were flying out with our daughter from Wyoming and meeting our son from Colorado in Ireland, a trip of a lifetime. Then, Covid hit and our trip was postponed. We were disappointed, but made a new plan for 2022. Our travel agent was able to rebook our tickets and we thought we were set. However, covid prevailed and our tour company again made the decision to wait. So here it is time to get tickets for 2023 and that is where we hit a huge snag. American Airlines refused to book us a ticket for 2023. We were told that tickets must be issued by September 30th and must be used by December 31st, 2022, no exceptions. Since our tour is April of 2023, it is not a plausible plan for us. We have tried to talk to American Airlines, but they say policy is policy. That is fine, but give us our money back. How can American Airlines just keep over $4000 of our money because of policy for no service rendered? Our son is the lucky one, he booked with United Airlines. No problem, they are happy to accommodate. We, however, have hit closed doors and feel cheated and mystified by American Airlines. My advice to everyone, do not fly American Airlines. They cause only disappointment and stress.   Horrible horrible experience with American Airlines! I will never book through them again. My husband and I had a 10 year anniversary trip planned to Jamaica. We were supposed to fly out with American Airlines at 10pm, October 31, 2021. We got an email at 6pm on October 31, 2021, an hour before we were to leave for the airport, that our flight was cancelled. AA cancelled our flight with a 4 hour notice due to a \"lack of staff\" I was told. Keep in mind we\\'d had this trip planned for months. We had arrangements made for who would watch our kids and when. We had all our Jamaica travel documents and negative covid tests ready to go. We had already dropped our dog off with the person watching her. There were no other flights that night, so in total panic mode, I began rearranging our entire trip! Luckily, I was able to book last minute flights through Delta and JetBlue for the following day, November 1, 2021. I had to push our entire trip back a day with our resort and reschedule our excursions we had planned since our original dates now didn\\'t work. The main excursion we wanted wasn\\'t available to book for another day so we lost out on that. I\\'m thankful we were able to still get flights through other airlines to still go, but now our negative covid tests were out of the 72 hour time frame. Frantically trying to find a rapid testing site, that was open on Monday, we found only one in our area that cost $130 per test. After all was said and done, American Airlines left us hanging with an unbelievable amount of stress and an unexpected expense of over $300 after the new covid tests and extra, unnecessary, night of dog boarding. On Monday, November 1, 2021 I called AA customer service number on their website, which is apparently only the reservations department. I told them what happened and requested a full refund and compensation for the unexpected expense. The man I spoke with was very nice, but said he couldn\\'t help with compensation and could only refund the plane tickets. Fine. He instructed to me to email customer relations about my complaint and to include that I could show proof of purchase for the new covid tests and extra night of dog boarding and that they should at least compensate me for those. I did just that, and they came back saying travel documents and covid tests were not their responsibility, but here\\'s a $100 AA credit to make it all better. First of all, I will never book a flight through American Airlines ever again. Second of all, I had all our paperwork and testing ready to go for the flight we had entrusted AA with in the first place. It was 100% their fault we were now in this situation and they refused to own up to it. I responded to the email my concerns and that a $100 credit wasn\\'t good enough and they pretty much told me to pound sand, that they weren\\'t going to do anything for me. I tried calling American Airlines again today, November 15, 2021, to express my continued frustration with the company and again no one would help. I\\'ve still only received half of my refund from our cancelled flights, so apparently AA just likes sitting on their customers money while screwing them over. I figure reviews are the best I can do at this point to hopefully help spare someone else from dealing with this nightmare of a company. American Airlines has ruined their reputation with me for life and I will be sure everyone I know knows how horrible this business is and how little they care about their customers!   The customer service on these flights is absolutely horrendous. The flight attendants are rude and callous and do not care for the customer at all. I was walking down the single person aisle and a flight attendant had the nerve to try and push her way through me, when I said excuse you she just scoffed and pushed herself through the rest of her way. Other flight attendants will knock into you, bump you, step on your feet and not even give so much as an apology. American Airlines you need to fix this ASAP. If your workers do not want to serve customers they need to see themselves in a different profession because this type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable.  Our mission trip to Africa was cancelled due to travel in vain. The airline failed to get us to our destination, it is as simple as that. There were 23 of us traveling together, all leaving from Albuquerque. Our American Airlines connection in Dallas was delayed so we missed our connecting Qatar flight which then spiralled into a nightmare\\xa0of trying to get our flights\\xa0rebooked for 48 hours. We were told that our tickets were booked and that our luggage would only go where our tickets specify (by multiple agents from Qatar and American) only to find out when we went to check in that our flights had not been rebooked, and later that our luggage was not remotely attached to our tickets (but halfway around the country or world without us). The nightmare we went through trying to get American and Qatar to talk to each other to make sure our flights were actually booked was an unacceptable fiasco that no paying customer should ever\\xa0have to go through. We went back and forth between the two counters dozens of times only to find out each time that their systems would not work with each other. This ultimately\\xa0ended in our trip having to be cancelled because the airlines could not get all 23 passengers on a flight to our destination before the gate closed. The lack of efficiency was only second to the lack of care and empathy on the Airline\\'s part. The customer service we experienced from American\\xa0throughout this process was abysmal- agents literally laughed at a hopeless mother of six who had been stranded for two days because of their system\\'s incompetence. We did everything in our power to ensure that we were working within the system requirements,\\xa0being diligent to double or triple check things (even though that is not our job) and get to the airport 5-6 hours early to be safe. None of it mattered. In the end the Airlines failed miserably to\\xa0treat us like respected customers or even with basic human decency.\\xa0Because of this disaster and being stuck in Dallas for nearly 72 hours we incurred thousands of dollars in expenses (hotel rooms, Uber rides, food deliveries). We hold American responsible for this nightmare, though Qatar played their part as well. If they had not closed the gate on 23 people 30 seconds before we walked up to the gate (and refused to reopen it) none of this would have ever happened. But it did happen, and now we need to be reimbursed for this horrific disaster.   Terrible service. Traveling alone with a infant, with window seat, airline changed without knowing to a middle seat and when asked to change denied me. Will never fly again. Very rude. Paid extra money for window seat just for it to be taken away.   American has been reducing steadily service and quality since Covid - and it is being noticed. My flight from Charlotte to Evansville was 1hr 20min, but no drink / snack cart was brought out. The attendant announced that drinks \"available upon request\" (and this has happened before), but only 2 asked for a soda. This flight had 1 open seat - due to the fact that American dropped the flights from Chicago to EVV forcing people to use Charlotte. The Admiral Club in Pittsburgh was closed 6 months in 2021 (for renovation) and is now open but closed on Sundays. And now the main club at Charlotte is down 6 months. The Platinum Pro / Sapphire phone-in number has a typical wait time of 3 to 4 hours, and then you get an agent with an Indian dialect that does not know how to navigate the Sabre system - so American has outsourced this service to India and I assume laid off the well trained U.S. agents we used to enjoy. Finally, American has changed their program to Loyalty points instead of flight miles and segments. In short, American has systematically cheapened everything about their service - for preferred and non-preferred passengers alike.   So I get to the airport in Santo Domingo two hours ahead of my flight and am told I need a negative Covid test to renter the US. My bad, I didn’t know this, so I went to get one in the airport. The flight was at five in the afternoon and I got back in line at 4:15. There were five people ahead of me, all bound for Miami. The problem was there was only ONE person working the AA counters. There were four others standing around doing nothing, including the AA priority person who had zero people in line. I spoke with him and the manager. The manager kind of gave me the “yawn” attitude. By the time I finally got to the one person working your counters she said it was too late to board. It was 4:35 pm. Then she said she would get me on a flight the next day. After leaving me at the counter for the better part of ten minutes while she went who knows where she finally came back and said I would need to pay $672 to get on the flight the next day. That’s almost twice what I paid for the entire trip, Norfolk to Santo Domingo and back. Here’s the thing. I could have made the flight, AA sold my seat to someone on standby and then wanted me to pay $672 to rebook. I called AA later after being stranded and got the same story, $672. On the phone I was told those are not AA employees. Well, then they have imposters posing as AA employees in AA uniforms with AA name tags working the AA counter in Santo Domingo. These people are dishonest, bordering on criminals, cheating hard working people…   Worst, the customer Service, cabin crew, specially main desk & boarding desk staffs at the airport are rude and unhelpful. All they care about their profit not customers. They rolled us twice which spoiled our 1 day of tour. Second although flights are expensive but there was no good Service or amenities. Never gonna waste my money in American Airlines.   On July 14, 2024 at 9:00 PM , we had a rough start at the airport, starting with TSA, very unprofessional and rude. My mom has Alzheimer’s and she was in a wheelchair and one person was telling me to do one thing and then another person was yelling at me to do something else so they were not agreeing with each other. They get a 0 star. We were told to go to different gates; it’s hard when you have a mom with Alzheimer’s. We were at the airport from 2:00 pm until after 9:00 pm. But we had the best pilot which help lighten the experience that we had at the airport. He took off with such ease that you couldn’t feel that we were in the air. He spoke to us on the loudspeaker and was very clear and precise with his words. During our delay he kept us updated with everything that he learned from our delay.  He was very professional and his take off and landing was very good and he deserves to be commended for his expertise on his flying skills. Also our flight attendants were very nice and friendly and professional. Our pilot to Washington on flight AA 5442 was awful!   We flew out of Palm Springs yesterday and our flight was delayed 2 hours. Then, when we arrived in Phoenix, the flight was delayed another 2 hours. On top of that, the plane was half empty and when my wife and I went to change seats to sit next to each other, the attendant yelled at us! She is also pregnant and we wanted to enjoy the flight next to each other opposed to separate. We’ve flown many times and the flights are rarely or almost never delayed. This was the worst flight ever and I heard many people say this would be their last time flying with American Airlines too. Get it together AA!!  Was supposed to use AA to fly to Baton Rouge for a COLLEGE graduation! Unfortunately I wont be attending because my 1st flight was delayed so much that we were going to miss the connecting flight asked what we could do even asked if the plane could be delayed (more than just myself were going to miss the connecting flight). We were told that couldn’t happen and try rebooking the flight. Wasn’t even possible due to the next available flight be AFTER graduation defeating the purpose of even going. The customer service reps were so nasty and in compassionate! And the “request” for a refund is just dumb! So all in all 0/10 would definitely NOT recommend Airline FROM HELL. Let’s not forget that sent me an email at 6:17 telling me the flight was changed to 6:27! No indication that the flight was delayed or anything which I didn’t find out till I got to the airport.  I was recently rescheduled in Seattle from Alaskan Airline onto an American Airline. The American ticket agent, D. Darling went above and beyond to vastly improve my hectic travel on 28 June, 2020. She was professional, courteous, kind and genuinely concerned with customer service. The flight was AA1618. This employee is a key employee and I feel is what any employer would love to having representing their brand. Thanks for your care and doing your job well.   We were coming home to Salt Lake City (SLC) from our trip to California (LAX). 20 minutes prior to boarding American Airlines informed us that our flight got delayed from 9:10am to 3:00pm because of maintenance issues. Then a couple minutes later they canceled our flight with no further information provided. We waited in a 2 hour and 25 minute customer service line after which no accommodations were provided. We ended up buying other tickets through Alaska Airlines and got a flight out at 7:50pm arriving at 10:50pm in SLC.  We were very friendly and understanding however that did not matter to them. We were just tying to get home with a sick 9 month old baby. I will not be flying with them again and would give them 0/10 rating if I could.  Well, I messed up and am paying the price for if and I hope this review helps others avoid the mistake I made. My flight was on Dec 26 so 2 days before I got my covid test, came back negative. I get on my flight to see the people I am traveling for and the flights are at full capacity. This made me uncomfortable, but I was already there, what can you do, they already made it very apparent that I would get no refunds for \"foreseeable covid issues\" so I got on the plane. Both legs of the journey were like this. I get to my destination and 3 days after, one of the people I am staying with tests positive for covid. Now of course there is no way to verify if I infact gave him covid, however you will have to take me at my word when I say this individual was very careful about following all proper precautions etc. Now my stay is consisting of finding a new place to stay, angering the family I was staying with and probably having covid (I personally have not gotten a test but have spent most of my time with the affected individual + probably was the one who gave it to him). Now I am aware of my personal choices made that factored into this outcome however cannot ignore the fact that utilizing the American Airlines service is how I most likely contracted the virus due to their ignorance of the proper covid guidelines. I hope this helps others when making their travel plans.   I booked a flight back in Sep 2021 for Feb 2022 trip, paid over $300+ to get seats with extra leg and aisle seat for my tall husband. American Airlines changed planes and decided it was ok to change our seats to a window seat? My husband is an athletic built 6\\'4\" man so I always pay for extra legroom and an aisle seat for him. Keep in mind I purchased my ticket 5 months ahead to make sure I got the seats I wanted. I was never notified by AA of the change. A few nights ago I decided to go in and check my itinerary to print for my folder. When I noticed our seats were not the ones I had purchased I called AA only to find out the wait was over 4 hours. I left my number to receive a return call. I did several hours later. The 1st CS rep was useless and rude. She basically told me that it is what it is and nothing can be done. When I hung up I was furious but decided that I have enough point to possibly upgrade. I called back and again had to leave my number due to the 4+ hour wait. The 2nd CS rep put me on hold and hung up on me.  I was furious by now. I called back and again left my number. Almost 12 hours from when this fiasco started I spoke to the 3rd CS rep. She was nice, I\\'ll give her that and very apologetic but again her hands are tied and she can\\'t help me. So now I\\'m stuck with a ticket for a almost 5 hour flight and my husband has to sit at the window seat because AA can\\'t help us even though I paid over $300 for those seats round trip. As a faithful AA customer, guess what? I\\'m not flying with them ever again.   My husbands flight was scheduled for 6 am. We got there to check in and the lady who was going to check us in was completely rude from the time we started to check in. My husband is a permanent resident here in the US so he can fly to Mexico with his residency card. This lady was not having it and said that he would not be able to come back into the country. After arguing about this for the next 20 mins, they finally said that he could fly. However, he would need another form of identification to go along with the permanent resident card. He had his Mexico passport but apparently that would not work. So they basically canceled our flight because we didn\\'t have the correct documents. To top it off, they said they would not refund our money! Only a credit to fly with their airline, which will never happen! American Airline staff was absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this airline at all. My husband ended up getting on a flight with United Airlines. He has flown with them a couple times before and had absolutely no problems!   My experience with American airlines was ridiculously horrible. Although it may be not the first time I flew on that plane but this will be my last. I have never seen someone delay their flight and then telling us that the plane arrived although the pilot left and doesn’t want to fly the plane. Then telling us that they are looking for a captain, officer, and pilot for them to be able to travel after delaying from 8:35 pm till 12:15 am. Finally when they all arrive we board the plane waiting inside for almost an hour telling us they are waiting for two passengers and then comes the captain telling us that he feels fatigue and he feels that it’s not safe for him to fly so they rescheduled our plane till 10 am in the morning. They did give us a hotel, although thinking about it the hotel is outside the airport in Chicago as well as we had to come back very early the next day so if we would have relaxed a bit it would be only about a few hours. Most of us passengers stayed at the airport waiting till 10 am and not just that but they changed our gate number 6 times that morning and we were just running around the airport finding our gate. Very bad airline.   This airline is so bad. 1) On the return flight the gate changed 3 times within an hour of departure (which was of course then delayed). 2) The APP is a pathetic dysfunctional mess. Every flight I go on the app and it doesn\\'t allow me to use the app feature to check into the flight and pick the flight. This is a joke. You are asking and directing your customers to use a tool that doesn\\'t work and is currently creating a horrible customer experience. Also it never applies the advantage account which increases the horrible customer experience. 3) The gate personnel seem clueless that their real job is to facilitate a great customer experience.  Don’t fly American Airlines and expect to be on time or treated like a human. The last two times I have flown they have been delayed or canceled and I had to stay in a hotel on my dime. Today, once again delayed and missing our next flight. With the grandkids, a four-year-old and a one year old. Stuck in an airport for over four hours. As always, thank you American for making sure that you guys get richer and we get screwed.  Salt Lake City to Mcallen. My review is of the airlines not the flight itself. My flight was cancelled. American Airlines refused to give a refund. All they would give me was a 6 month period to use my ticket. Not a voucher. With the world wide Pandemic, and my Senior citizen status, there is no way I am going to be flying in 6 months. I discussed all this with American Airlines and got no where. It actually appeared they were encouraging people to fly, for non-essential, reasons in the next 6 months. I was shocked at how clearly they were unconcerned for my safety. We have been asked by the governor of our state and the president of the United States to not make any unnecessary travel. I guess American Airlines doesn\\'t believe what the President and government officials are saying. I would not fly this airline!   This is the worst airline you could ever fly. So disorganized and chaotic, waited like 2 hours on my flight and an hour before even boarding, even though the departure time was past.   The airlines check in department would not let me board with my dog from Tucson. This was at 5AM. He has flown with them before, as well as I pay a fee of $125 to have him fly with me. He is ESA approved and they still would not let him fly so told me to make other arrangements. I had 3 hours to then get to Phoenix for my conneting flight and called ahead to let them know I had a pet flying with me. All was good until check in to receive my boarding pass. There is only 1 line with American to check in with pets, which cannot be done at the kiosk only with an agent. I waited in 3 lines for over 30 minutes and then was told my flight was closing the doors and they would not let me on. No calling them to let them know I was here and coming that way, no TSA pre check for security, just nope not going. Then they said we can get you a flight for 7PM but cannot guarantee you will be on it as it is standby only, I was checking in at 8AM to leave. Needless to say I missed my daughter\\'s baby shower for my new grandson and have never been treated so poorly by staff at an airline in my life! Be careful they are uncaring, unapproachable, non-negotiable agents. I was not even offered an alternative, just told nope.   I was supposed to fly in April 2020. obviously covid ruined my plans. I bought ticket insurance which was completely worthless because it covered nothing. They still refuse to give me my money back and just keep extending my when I can use it by dates but it has to be me and my mother. My mother is 65 and at this point not really wanting to travel anywhere. they wont let me move my money to someone else. Rude unhelpful customer service. If we fly and it doesn\\'t cost as much as i paid before i get vouchers for them. I swear once this is used I will never deal with American Airlines again.   American is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to airlines. I have never once flown American without an issue. The latest was the straw that broke the camels back. My flight home was delayed due to a mechanical issue. The plane was put out of service and we had to walk across the entire Miami airport to the new gate. Then we sat on the tarmac for an hour while this new plane had an issue that was cleared up. After 3 hours of delays we were finally headed to Atlanta. And wouldn\\'t you know, at 2 am when we landed (should have arrived at 11 pm) they don\\'t have the proper gate so we had to wait yet again on the tarmac while they tired to find which gate to go to and locate operations to shuttle us there. I will never fly American again. I would rather fly Frontier or Spirit than American.  I have been an AA Advantage member for decades and the experience my family and I had on Sunday Aug 1st, Mon Aug 2nd, Sat Aug 7th was by far the worst ever. American Airlines has really fallen off. Absolutely no customer service whatsoever. No matter what you do, you are directed to their website and expected to figure it out for yourself. Then when you are needing information that is not offered, good luck in trying to get in touch with a real live person. One of our flights was cancelled. It was scheduled to depart at 12.46 pm. Got notification early that morning saying it had a 15 minute delay. Ended up waiting 4 hours in Dallas, the plane finally arrives, and then was informed they were cancelling flight because they did not have a crew. Give me a break. American couldn\\'t see that they were not going to have a crew. I was able to rebook us on early flight next morning (no help from American), had to find hotel (again, no help from American). Lost the rental car we had reserved in Pensacola. Got to our final destination a day late but no luggage. Was told by American that we would have bags delivered by end of Monday. Late Wednesday finally showed up. By then we had to buy some clothes, and other essentials to get by. Fortunately the trip home had no cancellations but had delays. During this experience we definitely were left to fend for ourselves. Spent almost $800 related to this. Good luck on getting any of this back. Like I said earlier, the worst experience ever. American Airlines should fire those at the top, and get people in there that understand Customer Service, and that are not afraid to spend some money to improve their operations. It will be a long long time before I fly American Airlines if I ever do.   I booked my flight to Rome with them last month. I was supposed to fly to Dallas and from there to Rome. the morning of, 4 hours before my flight, i got a notification that my flight was delayed by 5 hours which would make me miss my connecting flight. That 5 hour delay turned into 8 hours. I called them and they offered, rebooking the same flight for the next day or canceling for a refund. I had to get to Rome as planned and so I couldn\\'t rebook. I asked for a cancelation and the agent helped me submit the refund form online at the same time. That was a month ago. Since then they have told me to contact the other airline and the booking website. Saying I got the ticket through them. Both companies mentioned that they don\\'t have access to the ticket because I canceled it directly with this main Airlines. I\\'ve called them multiple times since then and the last time they said I should fill out a complaint form so they could start the refund process again. I did so and the response I got was \"Thank you for contacting us. I\\'m truly sorry to hear about your experience. It is always our goal to run a timely and reliable operation, and we are sorry to see we missed the mark on your trip. We\\'re paying careful attention to the feedback our customers are providing us and the details you shared with us have been made available to our leadership to be used to improve our service. Your business means a great deal to us, and I\\'d like to ask for another chance to rebuild your confidence. Given the inconvenience you faced, we\\'ve issued a Trip Credit for you to use on a future flight. You will receive this credit in a separate email from us soon. From all of us at ..., we\\'re glad you chose to fly with us and look forward to caring for you on your next journey.\" My ticket is worth more than $1400 and they are giving me a $125 credit instead! I called them again today and they just say that they don\\'t do refunds on the phone and that i need to wait for a reply to my email. If I don\\'t hear back within 4 business days, I should fill out the complaint form again! I can\\'t believe a company as big as them is just trying to get out of giving back my money like this when their flight delay was the cause of all of this. 8 hours delay is no joke! Will never ever fly with them again and I highly encourage everyone to do the same. Flights are stressful as is and you want your airline to be on your side. I travel internationally often and no other airline has been as bad as them in my experience.   I was planning to fly home from Pensacola Florida to La Guardia New York on June 9th 2021 @3pm via flight number 4542. Departing at 3pm from PENS to NY. To be on a fully seated airplane doors closed and ready for departure to hear the following words “we must deplane the aircraft due to weather.” Totally acceptable safety before anything, we’re all at the waiting waiting just watching the screen turn from 3pm into 4:30 pm followed to 5:30pm to a vocal message stating the flight will not leave until 7:30pm a this point everyone is upset as the weather had cleared in Philly and no danger presented to new York. They refused to update the 7:30pm info on the screen or text message; they had made a verbal statement instead with the new time. The counter person excuse was that she had no control over any screens or messaging. There is nothing worse than feeling like you’re being held against your will and no information is provided other than to be back tomorrow at the same time , same flight 4542 at 3pm going to la Guardia. Now today June 10th, 2021 flight 4542 once again boarded the plane fully at 3pm when the announcer tells us once again we must deplane due to the pilot “timing out.” Everyone deplanes the aircraft with no information given except to wait around until further notice. Everyone feels like they\\'re being held against their will with no information, we all watched the screens go from 3pm to 4:30pm, 5:30pm to 7;30 pm to then a cancelled flight. No information was given. They tried to state it was due to weather but someone yelled out it\\'s perfectly clear to New York and they took the weather radar off the screens. To then tell us they can’t make any accommodations because the pilot is over his hours and the next flight will be Saturday.  I’ve never felt so violated of my time before. This is day two of me trying to go home my daughter who got a leg injury I am not from Pensacola I just want to get home to my daughter and my job in which I have been absent two days now due to American Airlines.   I had to cancel my flight 3 days prior to taking off, due to medical reasons. A nice lady at American Airlines customer service advised me to ask for a trip credit to temporarily delay the date of travel, because I had until February 3rd to book anywhere else. She didn\\'t advise me that my cash value of the tickets could change? This is stealing in my language and taking advantage of clients. On top of having a health problem at the time of flight, I am losing 1300$ because they decide to credit me 151$ per person. I was not made aware of this nor was I advised I would lose a substantial amount of money. I was told that I had until February 3rd and I am still within that delay. I am not asking for a refund. I was simply asking to delay the date of February 3rd to an alternate date. Without having to loose all of my cash value. All I want is to book a trip with my full value of 1600 before February 3rd, and they won\\'t give my cash value back.  What does it take to have the full value and amount of the tickets back. This is not good customer service and I will not let this go and will make sure I am within my right to use the full amount I have paid originally. I am disgusted with their customer service.   After a nightmare experience with United through the rest of my trip, I was booked last minute on an AA flight for the last leg of my journey from Cancun to Pennsylvania. The flight was perfect. No issues. My comment is important and I felt it was necessary because of our flight attendant. She was amazoning and made our flight not only enjoyable, but fun! Her name was Emmelin and I can’t rave enough about her. You hit the jackpot with her. I wish she could somehow be recognized for her service, but I hope this review for her is thanks enough from us. I will never fly United again. They made our entire trip a nightmare. Thanks, American Airlines. I’ve never had an issue flying with you and I’ll see you again soon!   It’s difficult to describe how bad American Airlines is. Utter chaos Dec 19 2022. Flight delayed with the famous rolling thirty minute delays. Changed to another flight. Plane taken out of set due to mechanical issues. Wait for new plane with zero communication from gate staff. “You know as much as we do. You’ll know when the new plane is coming when we do.”. Again, rolling delays. Original flight that was delayed ended up being delayed four times. Just awful gate staff. No help from AA customer service. You cannot count on anything they tell you. . Finally get to Cancun and missed our shuttle. Spent $70 for a taxi. Again. Difficult to describe how poorly this airline is run.   This is the worst experience I have ever had. While coming back from India, AA didn\\'t gave me any baggage allowance for my international flight ticket. I have pay for my luggage and then they suggested me to claim a refund. So after coming back I have to go through that hassle too. They are supposed to give us 3 meals in our 16 hour flight where as they just gave us 2 meals and they skipped the other meal by giving us an ice cream only. I\\'ll not recommend this airline at all. If they can\\'t give proper service, they should shut it down.   Absolute waste of money. Landed stating medical emergency and fact is something else. Stuck us for 24 hours at Madrid and also connecting flight got after another 24 hours.   So I don’t know what kind of stupidity happened but this is the worst airline in the whole world. Flight from ATL to MIA on May 28th 2022 was scheduled from 5.55pm with arrival at 7.55pm. The cabin is an E170 with a 2500miles range. Now the distance from ATL to MIA is roughly 700miles that means the cabin should always arrive with excess fuel and also be able to handle about 4hours of extra flight time. However not this time. Miami had bad weather and asked for 30mins holding time and the pilot said we don\\'t have enough fuel so we have to go to Fort Myers. I’m sitting in Fort Myers right now for about 2hours waiting to get fuel so we can go back to Miami. This was a weekend trip and I’ve already lost a whole night. This was the stupidest thing and it’s clear the issue wasn’t the weather but their lack of fuelling the plane back in ATL. They could have saved people a long time if they had just done their job right.   Horrible transfer management with American Airlines at Dallas international Airport. 2,30h transfer time and still missed our flight. AA was not able to rebook us to our final destination. Had to fly to Frankfurt and from there take a train home. Baggage got lost and arrived 11 days later. Although I had a lot of requests to customer service they did not refund us anything! Worst airline I ever flew with.  Flights delayed, no on board service was stated but was give to first class. Meanwhile I had to run to catch my connection flight because my first was delayed, currently 5 months pregnant and couldn\\'t even get a water on board. Incredibly uncomfortable seats, no social distancing at all. Awful.   Plane arrived 5 minutes late with 10 minutes to exit plane and next flight doors closed 10 minutes prior to flight. Had to run from b wing to e wing. Asked a worker to call e wing to tell them we were coming but they couldn\\'t get a response. Girl at e wing not notified. FAA has to mandate a minimum of 1.5 hours between flights the airlines sell.   They overcharge me $50, they charge me $50 to ensure that my baggage could go on the flight. I have medication in there that I need in case I have a medical issue, I paid the $50 when I got to the gate they refused to allow me to bring my small small bag onto the airline and made me check it because they said the cabin was full. But I had already paid for the space, when I tried to work with them to get the $50 back they essentially said sorry. I had booked through a travel agency cheapo air, they told me that the $50 was the airline fee in the airline had to give it back to me. But I have documentation the airline telling me it’s not their problem. It’s the travel agency problem. I don’t care whose problem it is they overcharge me $50 and did not give me the services and they should honor their airline and give me that money back. They are very lucky that I did not have a medical episode while I was on the flight. Do not buy into any of the extra booking fees because it’s all a lie and you will not get your money back.   Today was the perfect demonstration of putting greed and corporate goals before Customer Service. As someone who is a huge rule follower even I thought this was unnecessary and just petty. It demonstrated that all this airline cares about is the bottom line - yes money! My husband and I paid approximately an additional $26-36 per seat for the “upgraded” seats we chose. Keep in mind no other seats were available that were not an additional charge. I honestly don’t see what sets them apart from Spirit Airlines. We along with another gentlemen were the last to board the plane and the entire exit row isle was unoccupied so instead of taking the crowded row we were assigned to we quickly identified that row was open and sat in those empty seats and so did the gentlemen that boarded along with us. Keep in mind my husband is 6 ft 3 inches so an exit row would have been way more comfortable for him but instead the attendant quickly sprinted over to us to advise us that those seats were upgrades and also reminded us that we “didn’t pay” for them. I respectfully asked her if there was anyone else boarding the plane and if the seats were taken and she said “no.” I then asked her so wouldn’t it be better to have someone in the exit row to be able to assist in an emergency? She continued to give me the same answer. I quickly realized this attendant was not interested in winning the customer service badge today it was “follow the rules” day and she was well trained. I quickly gathered my belongings and moved the tow behind the empty exit row. A few minutes later another attendant walked over and thanked us for moving and advised us that there were Corporate Employees on board. That quickly told me that these employees are being raised up to follow the Corporate mission. Profit before Service! I now understand why Southwest has better ratings! Never again American!   Terrible - just terrible. Only fly with them if you want a bad experience; they go out of their way to ruin others’ happiness. It was important for us to not check luggage and only bring a carry-on. As difficult as that made it to pack, it was needed for our itinerary. American however forced us to check our carry-ons claiming a lack of space. We explained this would be a big inconvenience; they rudely handled the situation and insisted. Once on board, we noticed the overhead areas were half empty, and they stayed that way. Totally unnecessary. They messed up our trip by messing up our itinerary and ruined the start by putting everyone in a bad mood. Worse, they did it for no reason at all and while being rude in the process. They are a horrible airline, and the people that “helped” us, miserable.   Original itinerary: AUA 3:40 pm - arriving 5:30 pm MIA departing 7:30 pm-DFW arriving 9:30 pm Our original flight leaving Aruba was delayed originally until 6:30 pm meaning we would miss our connection in Miami. I received an email stating they had rebooked us to arrive in Miami at 12 am and depart from FORT LAUDERDALE at 7 am. We were traveling with 4 adults, 1 teenager and 3 children. They couldn’t tell us how we were going to get to Fort Lauderdale from Miami so we waited in 4 different lines we were told to go to in the Aruba airport (after waiting in the 3 hours worth of security & customs there) They finally got us re-booked to land in Miami at midnight still, and depart Miami at 3:30 pm the following day. We were told we would have a supervisor waiting in Miami with hotel accommodations. Couldn’t have been further from the truth. We arrived in Miami after not having food available for 6 hours due to the Aruba airport closing everything. We then had to wait in a 3 hour line to get hotel accommodations. After making it to the front of the line we were told all hotels in a 100 mile radius of the Miami airport were booked completely with no availability. They provided us with a tiny pillow and a small light blanket to sleep on the floor in the airport which was freezing. We then had no seat assignments and we needed the children near an adult as they are not old enough to sit with strangers (4, 6 & 8) we were told arrive at the gate at 1 pm for a 3:30 flight to receive seat assignments. Long story shorter we finally got help with seat assignments 15 minutes before boarding the plane. Every employee of American Airlines that we spoke with was rue nd not helpful.  The rudeness I encountered trying to get my family home from vacation after 30 hours with no sleep absolutely blew my mind. We approached every employee kindly even though we had been through hell and back and did not receive the same courtesy. I understand they deal with a lot of angry travelers but when someone approaches you kindly you owe them the same respect and it was not received. All we got besides the pillow and blanket was ONE $12 meal voucher per person. After this I will never fly American Airlines again.  London to New York JFK. A trip of contrasting flights - outbound was rammed full. I was sat in the middle aisle of 4 and the experience was sub-Ryanair. Zero space, zero comfort. As compensation IFE was good. Food was dreadful. Return leg, much lighter load and I secured the economy travellers’ holy grail of 4 seats to myself - economy business come on down! I got this flight very cheaply on a basic economy basis, no bags, no seat selection. I would have paid to choose a different seat, but non-US credit cards are not accepted on the app which is a bit rubbish!   By far the worst experience of my life. Airline refused to grant military dependent benefits that were promised via phone call. Check in clerk requested marriage certificate, ID, orders, and DL all to decline benefits. Complete waste of about 45 minutes.  As per my last flight experience, I want to give 0 out 10 and if possible negative rating also especially for international travels. I don\\'t recommend anyone for taking American airlines for international travels. I felt one of the worst customer care experiences ever. I missed my flight due to their backend and communication issues, even though its their issue, finally passenger need to suffer. They didn\\'t even book other flight, because of that I almost suppose to miss my next two flights. Customer care didn\\'t support even 1% percent also even when its their mistake. Funny thing is other AA partner airlines supervisor helped me in that critical situation. Finally I felt very bad for booking my international tickets in American airlines. After missing my first flight due to AA backend issues, since I didn’t have any other choice, I booked another next domestic flight to catch my international flight by paying higher price for ticket and luggage. Now AA still thinking to reimburse the rebooking flight charges also.   Chaotic. Everything with them is chaotic from ticketing to arrival. Checking in is chaotic, dropping off bags chaotic. They change gates, seats, sometimes arrive early others late. From crew to ticketing agents, all rude. My flight just got confused and landed in Dulles instead of DCA.  So 1 hour late.   Our connecting flight was a few minutes late. We got to the gate about 15 minutes early. The agent was rude and condescending and didn’t try to help.   I was originally booked to fly out on 7/7/23. I had paid for main cabin tickets, as well as for a seat with extra leg room, complementary alcohol, and a free checked bag (both ways). Within 24hrs I had to change my flight to the next day and was charged $57 for change in ticket price. The person I spoke with assured me the ticket change was equivalent with all the amenities I had purchased with the first ticket. At some point in time, American airlines changed my first flight to jet blue. When trying to check in for my flight tomorrow, I discovered that I was downgraded to coach and now have to pay again for extra leg room and I have to pay $30 to check a bag. Essentially I paid for something I am now not getting. This is simply unacceptable. I may never fly American again.  Flight to Milwaukee was delayed multiple times for several hours and eventually canceled. I understand things happen and was not initially that upset about the cancelation even though it resulted in me having to sleep on the ground in the airport for 5 hours. My return flight which was 4 days later, was also canceled within hours of departure. This flight was rescheduled for the following day. I have lost all confidence in American Airlines and will avoid flying with them in the future.   This airline is absolutely awful. I booked a flight with connection. The first flight was significantly delayed and caused several people on my flight to miss their next flight to Columbus, Ohio. As we all raced to try to catch the plane, they closed the gates in front of passengers that were literally standing there, after having ran to board. The rest of us were put on various flights and were told we were on standby for the other earlier flights. We found out that, in fact, we were not added as standby. My 6 year old and I have been waiting 7 hours for a flight now. I am absolutely livid! Please if you can, book with another airline. I’ve been delayed to a connecting flight twice in my life (avid traveler!) and both times was with American Airlines.   We had a great flight going to Rome Friday evening. This is my first time using American airlines. The flight was full and the boarding was orderly. I found the seats very comfortable. I sat in the back of the plane. The flight was uneventful and we landed on time. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. I am happy to recommend flying American airlines and hope my return flight is just as successful as the first one.   This has been a horrible experience from the start. I arrived at the airport 5 hours before my flight. After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, when I got to the counter to check my bag I was told they just closed checking bags for my flight. I called and rebooked. Thankfully, I was rebooked quickly. However, I am now on the flight and the door to the plane won’t latch. I have been here for hours and no answers. My son recently passed away and I was trying to get away for some peace. This has added to my already stressful life. I am so upset. I will miss out on at least one day of my vacation. I won’t fly American again.   I cannot recommend flying with American Airlines! When I flew to El Paso and had to change flights in Dallas, the flight got pushed back again and again and was finally cancelled at midnight. No explanation whatsoever. The hotel, they offered us, was downtown which was quite a drive especially because we had to be back at the airport at 5am. On my return flight it got even worse. The flight from El Paso to Dallas got delayed. When everyone was already on the plane they told us that the machine had \\'mechanical issues\\' and they needed to get a mechanic now to check it. Even though it probably was nothing major - that does not make you feel safe! Of course, I missed my connecting flight after that. So, I was waiting in Dallas for almost 3 hours till the next flight was going to Washington DC. Then, boarding was almost completed when flight attendants told us that the plane was somehow broken and they \\'just recognised\\' that! Again: not feeling very safe! How can you miss that a plane is not working?! When I asked for compensation - vouchers for food and drink - a flight attendant told me that’s not possible. The whole thing was a business trip and my whole schedule lapsed. So: if you can avoid going AA - do it!   The worst experience ever. My flight was for 7:45pm. I got here the recommended 2 hours early. During my wait the flight was changed 4 times all four times there was a switch in gates. But that’s not why I’m upset in the end they said 10:50pm we would board and at 10:53pm they cancelled the flight. The excuse was the pilot was fatigued. Wait so since 7:45pm there was no other pilot - or what about telling us this from the beginning so we could utilize the rest of our day. What about my hotel room? What about my transportation fees. And there was no flight one way available to grand rapids until 10 pm the next day. Because I waited here the entire time instead of finding another airline I am going to miss a funeral. How can you operate like this? And no accommodations like this was the worse. And no one available to rectify it or fix it. This isn’t fair so many people. We could of all figured something out since 7:45pm to 10:53 another airline something.   I specifically booked a later flight home so that we could enjoy part of our last day of our already short vacation. Now here I am the night before we leave rushing around packing because our flight got moved up almost 4 hours! I would be okay if they had moved us to a later flight but darn it some people have plans! I was not even notified that it happened until I went to check in for a our flight this afternoon.   So disappointed with American Airlines. Due to lack of staff in Madison wi on 9/26, my luggage was tagged with someone else\\'s name in Madison. Then flight canceled in Dallas. Received an updated text with new flight info leaving following Tuesday, this was on Sunday. I was meeting my cousins in New Orleans who were traveling from Seattle, my return flight was Friday afternoon. The gate we were to go to rebook new flight had only 1 attendant for while. I waited in line for 2+ Hours. Finally scheduled on am flight. I asked about luggage, I was assured it would be there in New Orleans. Nope. When I went to lost and found then check my claim ticket is when I notice wrong name and destination. Apparently whoever pickup luggage with my name on it never on to confirm with their baggage claim. Long story short, I wasted 2 hours there. They said they would notify. I called airlines contact, told them it must be in Dallas because that\\'s what baggage claim said. I called every day, on hold for at least an hour. They knew it was in Dallas. Promised everyday it would be on next flight out. I finally received late on Thursday evening. My life was in suitcase. I didn\\'t want to purchase because they kept saying it was coming. Unfortunately I lost my receipt from dollar general where I went to pick up basic items, plus additional items that were in suitcase. Finally on Wednesday went to town for an shirt, tank and shorts. Horrible stressful 5 days. The airlines will pay me the 60 dollars for my receipt. But will give me no monetary adjustment for items I needed to purchase with receipt. I am asking for them to use common sense . I needed basic toiletries. I do not want voucher. I plan to never fly American again. I was never rude to anyone I spoke with, not even when I person said I wasn\\'t a priority, however now I am mad and disappointed.   Birmingham to San Diego via Dallas Ft Worth. First they gave us a hard time and wanted to charge us more money to sit with our Mentally and physically disabled child after giving us a tongue lashing .. ultimately we didn’t have to pay and got to sit together but if they can’t accommodate disabled families without humiliation and extra cost there is a problem. Now we are having to return 7 days early from international travel due to corona virus and they are telling us we cannot reschedule our tickets because they are non refundable. We aren’t asking for a refund we are asking to return early. American Airlines is really unamerican! \\xa0 \\xa0Went to Cancun for my sister\\'s birthday and American Airlines is awful, I will never fly with them again. Rreated rudely by customer service in the airport and rude by customer service on the phone telling me all about their policies with zero empathy and absolutely no willingness to be of assistance. It was a disgrace, un organized, rude workers, flight delayed multiple times. AA customer service is a joke, it\\'s basically non existent. Planes are small and cramped. As far as I can tell there is no redeaming qualities at this point. Yes I am at the airport waiting for a delayed flight that they refuse to reimburse me for because I haven\\'t been inconvenience for a whole 24 hours yet.   So first my flight was delayed. I got to the airport at my normal time. I couldn\\'t figure out the check in system. I am used to scanning my credit card for my boarding pass. I couldn\\'t find the correct confirmation they needed. I stood and waited for help as two employees chatted. Finally got some help and they got me checked in and then told me I was 6 minutes late and couldn\\'t check my bag. I had to wait 5 hours to fly out again over six minutes, which I was there on time! I fly at least once a month and have never had this happen. I don\\'t plan to ever fly this airline again unless its my only choice. So disappointed in American. Im only in my destination for 2 nights and lost half of my vacation because of them.   Do not fly with American Airlines. I spent the entire day in airports while they tried to find pilots to fly their planes. My destination was BOS and after having 3-4 hour wait and even boarding the plane and then de boarding the plane I went to customer service to return to my original destination. I know other airlines are having the same issues but to be treated like cattle and causing emotional stress and anxiety for passengers is not a way to run an airlines. They do not deliver what they offer and choose another airline.   They had us sitting in the airplane cabin in Texas heat with no functional air conditioning for about 30 minutes before they turned the ac on. The cabin took another 30 minutes to cool down. Everyone in the cabin was sweating, complaining, babies were crying. Zero stars. Pick another airline.   I bought my tickets months in advance for 22 December 2023 at 2:07pm. I got to the airport at 9am to ensure I wasn\\'t late only to find out they had changed it to 5:30 in the morning. Apparently they had sent emails but I wasn\\'t aware until after the fact. Now I have to wait until 1159pm. They need to call you within a certain time frame if you haven\\'t acknowledged their drastic time changes via email.  The absolute worst experience. Canceled flight 3x, left 7 hours later by catching another plane thru Madrid instead of Heathrow. Lost my baggage, and could not contact American for 10 days. Spent over 10 hours holding on to the phone for service. American didn\\'t book my return flight, not sure how that happened. Good thing I called them, before to check because I didn\\'t see it on my app the day before departure. Gave me a credit for the entire flight then said it was a mistake. Credit was in my AA account for two months then when I went to use it. Just a terrible experience.   What a horrible experience. The airline is currently selling middle seats during this pandemic. I wish it was more clear that was the current business practice, otherwise I would have flown with another company. When I brought up that I was surprised, an attendant came back to me twice to make points about why it was okay or important. I felt it was unprofessional and unsafe.   I generally fly every other month and the customer service at American Airlines is beyond deplorable. I have reached out several times regarding issues and I rarely even get as much as an automated response. Whenever I need to get a hold of customer service it is next to impossible. When I finally do reach customer service I reach the most inept employees that do not seem to understand anything at all and are not willing to even try to help. I am not sure what\\'s going on, but it is absolutely absurd. I haven\\'t always had my flight number handy but I always have my name and advantage number and they refuse to help me without it even though I know they can. I was aggressive accosted on the runway by an unhinged flight attendant that though I was sneaking my cat on the plane. I bought him a ticket. If she had been at the ticket scanner when I presented that proof she would have known that. I was bullied by a flight attendant when I tried to get up to stretch because I have a serious disability which precludes me from sitting for long periods. The wifi tends to be spotty and they charge for it. They do not offer gluten free snacks a lot of the time or sometimes anything at all. The list of downright horrible experiences goes on and on. I hope they go out of business and no one bails them out again. The way they treat people and do not care they do not deserve to be in business.  Absolutely the worst airline, consistently. Never not had a problem with them. I’m a Delta platinum SkyMiles member too so I’m an experienced flyer. Been charged twice for the same flight because they are such a scam. Consistently have problems with them. Do yourself a favor and fly United or Delta.   Last time I ever fly this airline, ruining my trip and me attending my brothers wedding. And they don’t care, simply don’t care. They kept delaying and delaying the flight with no update or information as to why, they don’t care.   It’s was very well announced in Nashville TN that on the 6th of Jan 2022 will be snow storm, so my flight route was 6th Jan from Nashville- Chicago - Amman -Iraq round trip. I had to pay $95 to Uber due to the snow and went to airport 3 hours ahead of time, checked in my bags, then when time came we boarded the airplane and sat there for almost 3 hours. At that time my second flight from Chicago to Amman was already gone, after waiting long line where there is only one agent who was sweet and polite but way over whelmed by issues has to deal with. I ended up changing flight to 8th of Jan instead of 6th. Well my problem now is I have only 7th of Jan to do Covid. Pcr test when the whole city is locked down due to the weather. I spent the whole day driving all around Nashville looking for a place regardless the pay to do Covid test and I couldn’t find any. Contacted AA customer service and scheduled after 4 hours. The lady has nothing to say about the snow but I must provide another pcr test or I could lose my ticket altogether. I went to my doctor today 1/7/22 and asked for rapid antigen test and report, wen back to airport but they do not accept the paper. So they delayed my flight when I was in time, change it to another day and I have to do another pcr test and my responsibility otherwise I lose my ticket. My bags were sent to Chicago and not sure when or where to get them back.   By far the worst airline in existence. Flights are constantly delayed and customer service is a joke! If you are reading this review. I beg you to learn from series of unfortunate events and avoid this airline at all cost  Today the ticket counter was fully staffed and quickly moved people along with their check-in and luggage. While there is plenty this airline has done poorly, this morning went smooth. Thank you.   If i could give a 0 star I would, worst experience ever! First off, they had me separated from my daughter who is a minor but had me and my fiancé together. I spoke with customer service multiple times when booking both tickets separately, we had to book them separately in order to use the credits. They guaranteed me that we would still be together as if it was one ticket, but guess that was a lie! I check in the day before and I noticed I was separated from my daughter. I called customer service and they told me that once i get to the airport that they would be able to put my family together. Another lie! It was literally a hassle to get the first flight to be together, but they were able to move seats around for it and made it happen. Now we had a layover and same issue, I was separated from my daughter so I went to the gate and explained what customer service had told me and that the last flight was able to move things around because she is a minor but nope not this time. All they had to say was the flight was pretty full and that me or my fiancé would have to take her seat! Like are you serious!? This was the airlines fault for miscommunication from the start! I have high anxiety with flying and so does my daughter! I’m furious and this has been the worst experience of my life! Not to mention on the first flight, They literally asked my man to cover his shirt because it was offensive, and then they’re harassing a family because their 5 year old is being disruptive.... like I’m sorry but when did our freedom of speech get taken away, and do any of them have kids? Sometimes kids have a bad day and act out. Is that any right to move them to a different seat or kick them off of a plane!?  This airline is terrible. Rent a car way less people and delays. Got delayed hours both ways. Staffing weather, nothing but excuses and insincere apologies. Sell the airline to persons that care about customer service   Los Angeles to Boston. Cancelled my trip in March due to COVID-19 concerns and didn’t receive a response until now. I was denied a refund. I will never be traveling with American Airlines ever again ! Explain to me how I am getting denied a refund for cancelling my trip over safety reasons?  Horrible. My plane was supposed to leave from DSM to Chicago at 6.05am, the pilot called at 5.30am to say he was sick. They then changed our flight to 7.45am with a replacement local pilot who at 6.14am cancelled or was unable to get a hold of the pilot. So our flight got changed to 10am. It is now 9.51am and they have not even called us to start boarding the plane so no telling if the pilot is really here or just running behind. So unprofessional. The attendants and customer service offered me $12 voucher for food when let’s be honest that won’t get you far at an airport. No other compensation. I have never experienced such an unprofessional, inconsiderate, and rude experience in my life. I’m in disbelief with their customer service.   I\\'ve always considered AA to be generic standard quality at reasonable price, and have never been disappointed on that note. I can\\'t really think of anything special either positive or negative. I have had some delayed baggage on occasion, as I did the most recent time. It was returned to me within 24hrs. I watched a bag handler just leave the doors open on the trolley and drop bags out of it this same trip. That\\'s about it, really just mid-tier every which way. I\\'ve never had a MAJOR issue with them, so that\\'s positive enough. Can\\'t even remember a serious flight delay or cancellation, and I probably fly with them twice a year. I would say their seats are a bit above average on comfort, though with limited recline of like 5 degrees. You don\\'t get much food with them, though, really underwhelming. Did a 4hr flight and got a cookie.   On the American Airlines flight to LAX, even though I was in First Class, the flight attendants couldn’t even be bothered to give us a glass of water or champagne before we took off. It took nearly an hour to load that international flight. On the flipside on my one hour flight from LAX to Phoenix the lovely flight attendant gave us all drinks before we took off. I am done flying American internationally. The service is the worst of any airline and the prices are the most expensive of any airline. I have been an executive platinum flyer on American for over a decade but enough is enough. I’m going to fly an airline from now on that cares about its passengers.   Worst airline ever! Tried to book a ticket for my 15 year old son to visit his brother in LA and the website said to call to book over the phone. Waited 45 minutes to speak to a representative and he said I had to pay $150 fee for a minor traveling alone! The ticket was $90. Never heard of anything like that before. Book flights for my teens with Jetblue, Delta and other airlines all the time and never heard of a fee because the kid is under 15. Also, the flight is November 12 and his 16th birthday is November 17. Will never use American Airlines again. What a rip off!    Was shocked at the flight attendant’s attitude. We were on our flight back from New York to London Heathrow after spending a weekend away for our first wedding anniversary. The staff were passing out the meals and, by the time the attendant on our side reached maybe three rows in-front before us, the flight attendant started just throwing meals on peoples tables and not asking if they wanted chicken or pasta. My husband and I assumed they had none left and just accepted, however we heard the next side being given the option of chicken or pasta. My husband very kindly asked Raul why we were not given a choice. His response, in an extremely blunt tone “you don’t get a choice” which completely stunned us. My husband then, again politely mentioned about the next row and he then went uncaringly ‘well we get a number for each side’ We understand this however the attitude was unnecessary and felt like a completely power move. He got my husband a pasta from the other side, he thanked the FA to which he sarcastic went “yeah”. I thought it was incredibly rude, unnecessary and just put us both in a bit of a blue mood for the rest of the flight. We had been on our wedding anniversary, just because we are at the very back of the plane does not mean we do not deserve service. I will not be flying with them again. This FA continued to be unfriendly for the rest of the trip and made me feel incredibly uncomfortable.  15+ hours total for a maybe 3 hour flight! Tried taking with airline employees and 90% of them were just rude. My luggage was lost for hours and no airline employees were willing to help locate them, they just wanted me to file a claim. I contacted customer service to see what we could do about it and they offered me 2,500 extra reward miles!! No 2,500 fly miles will not suffice for the experience that I had to deal with. I do not plan on flying American anymore... I tried speaking with someone else through customer support and was told that she\\'s all I get. Get right American, I\\'d rather fly Spirit.  I wish I would\\'ve read reviews before booking my flight. American completely ruined the first day of a vacation for my family. Apparently constant \"maintenance\" issues and excuses for delays are very common with them. Weather was great, flight boarded on time, come time for take off, oh we have an issue, it\\'ll be 45 min. Then after another 30 come with more delays and excuses but then offer to allow people to get off the plane, but not other flights going to Key West so if you get off you\\'re SOL. After an hour and a half we were taken off the plane, told to walk to a completely different terminal, and gate, which isn\\'t an easy task at such a large airport. Eventually loaded on the second plane only to be left sitting for another hour+ before takeoff. The 3 hour delay meant the rental car place was closed when we arrived. Was my first and I promise will be my last American Airlines flight.   Completely unethical company taking advantage of the covid situation. I had to cancel my flights due to Covid and after spending hours (Waited for 2 hrs the first time then had to wait a day for them to call back then had to wait an hour for a supervisor) on the phone trying to talk to someone in order to use my travel credit they refused to apply it to my new flights and wouldn\\'t work with me at all. They even refused to send me an email telling me they are denying my request so I can show my credit card travel insurance.   I have flown American 30 times in the last 10 years and maybe one time has the flight been on time. Luggage has been lost multiple tines and the customer service doesn’t care to help. I am active duty military and have been charged multiple times for luggage even though they say military doesn’t pay for baggage. If I have any other choice and I don’t care how much more it cost me I will fly anyone else or drive if American is the only choice. Horrible airline.   Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had flying with any airline! Departure from Mobile was scheduled for 2:25 pm. Delayed due to mechanical issues they said, finally boarded at 6:23pm and delayed again because while fueling, the fuel truck ran out of fuel. Finally up after 7:00. I had called AA early on to check on different connector and was told it would not be any problems if I missed the original. Finally made it to Charlotte only to be told I’d have to fly to LaGuardia and catch another flight on Friday to Washington, then another to Buffalo. If they would only tell the truth I would never have boarded in Mobile. Now I’m stuck in LaGuardia, no one will help! Worst customer service ever. Airport is closed, can’t find my bags, and was told it wasn’t their fault because it was all due to weather. BS!!! There wasn’t a cloud in the sky in Mobile, and Charlotte was clear also. Totally lied to everyone on the flight. Never will I fly with American again.   The flight from Lafayette was delayed due to thunderstorms. The Captain did a wonderful job of keeping us updated and presented with both humor and attention to detail. The flight and terminal crews were very helpful in guiding passengers in procuring alternate flights. One young passenger became very tearful and anxious. Our flight attendant, Jacqueline, was amazingly comforting, compassionate, professional, and helpful. She is a true asset to AA! The entire crew was stellar!   I was traveling to New Orleans from Greenville via Charlotte by American Airlines. There was a 1.5 hour transit at Charlotte Douglas Airport, but the flight made delay at Greenville Airport. So, in transit I was almost running to catch the flight to New Orleans. Ground Staff were helpful to keep the aeroplane waiting for few more minutes for the transit passengers. Cabin crews were good in this particular flight. Aircraft was good. Very light snacks was provided.   Very unprofessional service by both on the pre-flight personnel and flight attendants. On board staff was more concerned about gossiping amongst each other than serving the customers. I will not be flying American Airlines in the future.  The flight was supposed to depart to Doha at 8.45 pm. For some reason it was delayed until 12.30. At 12.30, they allowed passengers to board the flight. Once everyone was seated, there came an announcement that they cannot fly as some allowed time has crossed. All the passengers were asked to go back to the terminal. And every American Airlines staff left. One guy came and said AA cannot provide the accommodation as the delay was due to weather. Checked in baggages were not given back, no staff was available to rebook the flight/connection flight. No one had a clue on where the baggages were. What kind of company will just abandon their international passengers in the terminal and let them figure out things on their own? I have had bad experiences flying before but no one showed this level of arrogance and irresponsibility.   If I could rate them lower than a one star, I would. To make a long story short, I was attempting to bring a pelican case full of expensive camera equipment onto the plane as a carry on. It was small enough and easily contained $10K worth of equipment inside. While at Ronald Reagan, I was told that I must check the bag or not get let on. I reluctantly handed over the pelican and was assured that the luggage was in good hands. I found out once arriving in Phoenix that baggage workers stole nearly $8K worth of equipment and are also are refusing to cover the loss. If you fly with them, do not check anything of value. There isn’t a guarantee that it will be there when you land. And yes, there were no lithium batteries in the case; just in case if American Airlines is reading this.  This is the worst experience ever. We will never fly this airline again. The flight was delayed, we then got on the plane only to be told to get off and the flight was delayed another 10 hours. To be rebooked on a flight that took us extra days to get to our destination and now we are dependent on vouchers for a hotel!  I can safely say that I will never book with American Airlines again. I am a traveling nurse and every 1-2 months I book a flight back home, so I have flown frequently with many different airlines. I had a bad experience with AA on a previous trip, but I decided to try them again for the sake of convenience. I was hoping my previous bad experience was a fluke, but my most recent trip was even worse. American Airlines delayed my outgoing flight that was scheduled at 8am and did not notify me until a little before midnight the night prior to departure. The delay would cause me to miss my connecting flight and all alternative flights were full. An hour long customer service call got me a flight out of an alternate airport 2 hours away at 08.20am. I decided to take the hit and lose sleep to drive myself 2 hours in the morning, because I have heard from many people how impossible it is to get a refund from American. I arrived to the airport and stepped into the check-in line at 7.06am thinking I had plenty of time to make my flight. There were 2 people ahead of me in line and 3 agents assisting customers already at the counter. The service was so slow that I did not get to an agent until 07.41am at which time they informed me that they could not check me in and that I had missed my flight...which didn\\'t take off for another 40 minutes. Then to make matters worse they informed me that American would not give me an open seat on a later flight, because they wanted to keep them open for potential buyers. They refused to refund my ticket and the best they would offer was a stand-by position on a later flight and another stand-by position on a connecting flight that meant I had to wait around an pray that they had an opening on 2 fully booked flights. I eventually made it home, but since I purchased a round trip ticket I had to return via American as well. My return trip consisted of them switching my upgraded (more expensive) seat to an economy middle seat without refunding my money, then delaying my flight for an hour while we were already seated on the plane, which caused me to sprint across terminals to make my connecting flight. Then my bag ended up being loaded on the wrong flight, which meant I had to wait in the airport for 2.5 hours after arrival just to collect my luggage. American Airlines is a complete joke. They know their customer satisfaction scores are in the toilet, but they are happy to run their airline like a complete circus, while trying to leech money out of people in any way that they can.   The aircraft was clean. Both departure and arrival were only 20 minutes late and the business class seats were very comfortable, including a larger than usual footwell which was wonderful. However, the cabin was severely understaffed and the cabin crew gave the impression of being annoyed at serving passengers. As with my JFK-ATH flight several weeks earlier the food served was close to inedible. On both flights AA offered a single appetizer of shrimp ... for anyone with allergies to shrimp or religious problems with said shrimp - tough luck. Further to meal service, drinks were served only once, no coffee or tea was ever offered. My Inflight entertainment did not function except for the first hour of the flight. Ninety minutes prior to landing we were told to expect severe turbulence for the next 45 minutes and thus no second meal service. There was not a single bit of turbulence nor a second meal service. We considered this to be deliberate. A very comfortable seat was the only positive of this flight. Everything else was the worst I\\'ve experienced in 40 years of flying.   Dallas Fort Worth to San Francisco onboard their Airbus A321. My previous flight with American was good but I couldn\\'t find the \"punch\" factor that made American Airlines special. This time, I was surprised that American Airlines had become so excellent. Check-in at DFW was done in a very fast manner, and maybe because I arrived way too early, I experienced 6 gate changes - from A16, then B7, B9, B11, C29, then C12 (thank Goodness DFW had a reliable Skylink). However, that was pretty much the end of my moan because once I stepped on the plane for boarding, I was welcomed by a (surprisingly) very energetic set of crews who smiled at and greeted me. I soon proceeded to my seat, 18A, which was pretty much basic with no IFE screen, but it had USB charging ports, universal power sockets, some literature items, and a decent amount of legroom and padding. The cabin, featuring larger overhead bins like the ones in the A321neo, was spacious, comfortable, and in its best condition despite the toilets being inoperable for short flights cruising under 16000ft (we cruised at twice that altitude, so no issues). The Wi-Fi was blazingly fast and the entertainment had plenty of contents that were up-to-date and beautifully laid out. The pretzels and drinks provided on the flight were delicious. Throughout the flight, the cabin crews remained passionate, friendly, cheerful, and lovely. This might be a little bit overboard of me to say, but the crews of this flight were on par with the Japan Airlines and Starlux Airlines crews that I met. We took off from DFW an hour behind schedule due to a changing traffic flow control, and landed at SFO just 25-ish minutes behind schedule, allowing me plenty of time to catch my connecting flight. American has continued to surprise me for the better, and as an AAdvantage member, this flight affirms my loyalty and love towards them.   Flight 2827 at 2035 from Dallas to Columbia SC on Wednesday 9/29/21. returning from burying my brother-in-law who\\'s a soldier. My husband also a soldier still grieving tries to distract himself by watching a \"free\" movie but the airline doesn\\'t have any headpiece and of course we don\\'t normally carry a headpiece or earphones wherever we go so he turns it up a little to hear it. I guess it was a little too loud as the stewardess asks him to turn it down. My husband apologized and turned it down. What she said next is what bothered me most. My husband and I were both stunned at what she said and I had to bite my lip so I don\\'t make a \"Karen\" scene. She said to the other passenger \"they think they\\'re at home or something\". What do you mean \"or something?\" You mean like we\\'re on vacation or something? Lady, what we\\'re feeling at this time is far from \"or something\" and you just made it worst to the next level. You really don\\'t have to make yourself look good by saying what you said to the other passengers. You all were probably looking and snickering behind us but thanks to you the rest of the flight was humiliating and you certainly tainted the airlines name in our view. So next time you make a comment like that think twice because you don\\'t know what people are going through.   \\r\\nThe absolute worse! My flight was delayed for over 7 hours. With no explanation, compassion or assistance. I have a surgery scheduled for the 8th December, 2021 in Miami and that’s the only reason why I booked with AA. I don’t understand how this airline is able to do as they please without any legal recourse to its passengers. I will never book with this airline again. Absolutely horrible customer service as well. Such a scam!   I had reservations to fly out of San Diego yesterday but my connection was canceled (supposedly for weather). Then my flight for today was canceled for the same reason. I now have a flight for tomorrow. Anyone want to take the odds that this flight will actually happen? I give it 20%. If you don’t have to fly American Airlines don\\'t. I had upgraded seats that they will not honor. I kinda hope they cancel tomorrow’s flight so I can fly with a real airline. Do you think they offered a hotel room or meal tickets? Not a chance.   Our flight got canceled and they sent us to Phoenix and rebooked our flight for the next day and they canceled our flight again next day very unpredictable and unprofessional. I am at a loss for words and advising you guys to please take a different airline. And save your time and get we’re you need to go. People have been stuck here for days because of this horrid airline.   I was a passenger on American Airlines flt # AA1948 1/14/20223. It departed at 4:54 pm. I would imagine all flight attendants were tired as it was at the end of the day on a Friday. I witnessed a flight attendant in the area I was seated (23C) disrespect and treat an elderly gentleman with great rudeness. She was rude to everyone she came in contact with.  As she was providing beverages she came to my seat and said \"what do you want to drink\" in a tone that quite frankly almost prevented me from speaking. I replied \"I would like water with a smile\" She replied, \"with a what?\" I said with a smile, hoping to make her day better and treat her nicely. She told me I would not know if she was smiling due to the mask and then she moved on down the aisle to harass other passengers. After landing a recording come on thanking us for choosing American Airlines and they acknowledged that we had a choice in who we fly with. With flight attendants such as the one I have described, I think I know my next decision on the airlines I will fly with and the airlines I won\\'t fly with. American Airlines, I hope you can make flying with your airlines a positive experience as you once did. The travel world has changed but your competition is providing an enjoyable experience.   The plane was packed like sardines. No social distancing from the moment I walked in the terminal. When I got off the plane in Charlotte the area was so packed with people we couldn\\'t get through to exit plane. They don\\'t even give you water on the plane, no internet or TV on the plane.  American Airlines is truly disconnected from the needs of the average consumer. For example, I purchased a round trip flight but because of Covid and other holiday complications, was left with only needing my return flight. American Airlines cancelled my flight home leaving me stranded in another state during the holidays. Now I am sure in the fine print this is allowed but to add insult to injury the representative on the phone gave me only one option, and this was to re-purchase my seat for 3x the original cost on top of my original purchase. Additionally, the representative on the phone was callus and nasty and on top of that, many layovers were added to my original flight. I will never use this airline again.   I had to check 3 bags on my trip to the Virgin Islands with a layover in Miami. 2 of the 3 bags are brand new but to look at them after the trip looks like they were caught in a war zone. I’m not kidding or exaggerating. Not only were the bags in terrible condition, but lots of items were stollen from the bags that the airline “refuses to take responsibility for”. So now not only do I not get recompensed for the stolen items, I have to worry about new items that I purchased while on vacation for my loved ones being stolen on the trip back. I was told that unless the culprits come forward there is nothing that they will do to remedy this situation. Also I was told to ship the items through a reputable company so I guess the airline is not reputable since I obviously can’t use them as means for safely transporting my souvenirs. I’m sorry but I will never fly American Airlines again. I have zero faith in their staff not to steal my items and since I was told that they will do nothing about this I am looking into getting a refund for my return ticket so that I can get a flight on Delta or JetBlue. If you have security grade luggage that can be locked and not tampered with I say ok fly with them and check the bag but if not, save yourself the trouble because it’s not worth it.  Charlotte to Las Vegas via Phoenix. First let me thank the airline personnel for their efforts and customer service. As for the airline itself, I’ve flown American 3 times in the past 3 years and they never fail to disappoint. Hours late, sitting on the tarmac for hours and canceled flights. Speed in flying is a wonderful convenience but AA has found a way to regularly frustrate this. Their inconsistencies make it very difficult for the ground personnel to do their job. I think the CEO should sample his own service and find out first hand how inefficient their system has become. I will do my best to avoid AA in the future.   Third class airline. My Boarding card showed Gate no. 27, When I reached, I saw no one, Then I asked a crew member they sent me to D4 Terminal, When I reached there, they again sent me to D11 gate and said because of the system they are changing the gate. When I reached, they closed the gate and the flight was gone by that time. I had to catch another flight. I went to American airline counter, The lady was so rude on D Terminal. When I requested for help she stopped me in a conversation and said \"if you use one more word I am not going to help you, then said why didn\\'t you choose another airline and finally she totally damaged my whole route. I was in Miami with no help, No hotels no food they gave me. Then Qatar airways helped me and said American airlines cancelled my whole route when they were reissuing my ticket. I had so much trouble that I never faced. I have travelled many countries with different airlines. I think American Airlines crews learn from any Asian countries airlines how to deal with customer, behavior and hospitability. Never forget, We pay for the service, not granted.   Was supposed to have 45 min flight from Key West to Miami. Plane had issues with the steering mechanism. Had to deplane. 4.5 hours delayed, missed a very important meeting and they won\\'t even give me a voucher for a sandwich or a drink. Will never fly American Airlines again.   Very poor customer service. By far the worst I\\'ve ever experienced. We were scheduled to fly out of Memphis to Miami onto Montego Bay on June 9. We checked in via the app on 6/8 to ensure a speedy boarding process the next day off. We arrived at the airport at 310AM to depart at 521AM. To our dismay, the flight was canceled and rebooked for Saturday!! Our current reservations were 6/9 - 6/12. The new plans were not going to work. We were ushered to stand in a long line for customer service. After standing there for 2 hours, Maria assisted us. This woman didn\\'t have any compassion or empathy for the situation they caused. She gave us two options take it or leave it. 1. Be standbys. For today and hope we get on. 2. They put us on a plan to DC. Then onto NY, sleep in the airport because they can\\'t offer hotel accommodations. And finally arriving in Montego at 107PM Friday. Both options meant we miss participating in a wedding that was planned months in advance. We stressed the sense of urgency but to no avail. The agent never offered anything different. She said to call customer service that\\'s all she could do. Never once did she mention to book via another airline. My spirit was truly broken. My husband was livid to say the least. We missed the wedding. I will never book with this airline again and highly advice others to do the same. Save yourself the heartache.   I posted earlier today on the hopeless professionalism of American Airlines, ridiculous! My last post we were delayed several times and changed gates 4 times (does anyone know what’s going on?!). Our ordeal extended to our flight being cancelled after several hours of false promises. My family went to “customer service” and received nothing remotely close to any customer service. We were given “options” that were unrealistic. Then the AA rep got upset! My family was left with no means of getting home possibly for the entire weekend! American Airlines could not care less! The one glimmer of professional service we received was from a customer service rep who got us to our destination at 9pm (8 hrs late but she did it because she cared!). She was the only person who cared! American Airlines cares nothing of their customers.   I purchased a ticket to fly from Sacramento Ca, to Killeen Tx. on American Airlines for $175. On 08/19/20021 my connecting flight 2733 at LAX airport loaded passengers without inspecting the plane. After the plane was loaded with passengers the pilot announced that the plane had a flat tire and we\\'ll have a delay, we had to wait on the runway until the tire was fixed for over an hour. Due to the wait and inconvenience, I missed my connecting flight to Killeen Tx that left from DFW airport at 10:51pm. American Airline is very disrespectful and inconsiderate I was given a ticket for the next day 08/20/2021 to leave at 2:20 p.m. and a hotel voucher at a 2 Star hotel the Quality Inn & Suite. The hotel is over 15 miles away from the Airport. I also was given a Taxi voucher because there weren\\'t any shuttle buses after 11 p.m. in which I felt very unsafe being a woman traveling alone late at night. Why wasn\\'t I given a sooner convenient flight to leave in the early a.m. morning? Why was I given a Hotel Voucher near the \\xa0airport? The room is dirty, the bed isn\\'t clean, curtains are filthy, and the face cloths are stained. I have pictures of the hotel room if needed. Also I have no luggage due to the delayed connection. I would like a full refund for my airline ticket of $175 or flight credit for my inconvenience. I\\'m a loyal customer and have preferred to travel by American Airlines to fly until now. This is not how you should treat your customers.   This is the worst airline. I have a temporary disability that has me confined to a wheelchair. I requested assistance in advance to help me get on and off the plane and to make connections. At Dallas airport my incoming flight was delayed because of equipment blocking the gate. The gate attendant stated I did not have time to use the restroom but when I explained I was happy to use the plane facilities with assistance I was told no. I expressed that I did not want to take a later flight but if that I was not allowed 5 minutes to use the restroom prior to the flight ( a three hour flight) that I would have to get up during the flight and that if I fell it would be the airline’s responsibility. The gate attendant then stated that she would not allow me on my scheduled flight regardless of my request to not be moved to a later flight. She was extremely rude and talked over me when I tried to explain that I could not get out of my seat while in flight without assistance. This airline claims to accommodate disabled people but I did not feel they even tried in this instance.  Absolutely no compassion whatsoever. I tried to file a complaint with the airline regarding this matter and although the customer service that helped me write the complaint was wonderful the response I received was a very generic reply. I have been unable to speak to anyone regarding this and the email response to my submission was basically an apology “but we don’t feel as though our employees did anything wrong!” So in summary I will never fly with American again and I definitely would say that in regards to accommodations for people with disabilities they probably don’t even comply with the basics required. I definitely felt discriminated against. I was out right bullied by their employee and was literally in tears at their treatment. Not to mention their follow up on the complaint was basically almost worse than no response at all!   My Girlfriend and I planned a trip to Aspen  last month which will take place next week. Unfortunately I chose American over United for the trip. Today, I find out that American canceled my particular flight (the only flight that goes into Aspen) and I would not be able to fly into Aspen until “maybe Saturday” (trip is Thurs-Mon). The only way to still be able to keep our trip dates and the hotel I already paid for would be to fly into Denver. Which also means I get to spend about 3 hours both ways driving and about $400 on a rental car. If I wanted to fly into Denver in the first place, I would’ve booked it and paid half the price. I voiced my displeasure to American Airlines customer service and they simply do not feel any refund of the fare difference (its typically double to fly into Aspen rather than Denver), a free checked bag or any other means of saying “we’re sorry for ripping you off”. They clearly do not care about their customers. I know this will be the last time I give them any money for anything.   Honolulu to Phoenix in First Class. Comfortable seat but a lack of real food. After take off I was served a soda in a plastic cup, along with tiny packets of corn nuts and almonds. Prior to landing orange juice in a plastic cup. The AA website shows what is served depending on flight length, none of which applied to this flight. A flight attendant, Carrie, addressed me by name and that\\'s about as First Class as it got. She\\'s the reason I might consider flying AA again.   The flight took off on time. Food was okay. Water and other cold beverages were offered several times during the flight. They also collected the trash couple of times after each service. Ice cream cup was served in the middle of the flight. Snack before arrival was so so. The seats are okay. On board entertainment - I had trouble finding something interesting to watch. This was return flight. To point out the food on outbound flight was horrible - especially the dinner- inedible mess.  I called to cancel my flight because my partner tested positive for covid. They told me the flight was canceled and I would be fully refunded. The day before my flight they send me an email to check in so I called to make sure my flight was indeed canceled. No, they never canceled my flight and then told me since it was not a 24 hour notice then they cannot refund me. All because they didn’t document my call nor cancel the flight when I called days prior!   Does anybody who works in a position of power actually care about the consumers? Seems like complete lack of service can all be attributed to covid now. Flights are delayed with no reason given and it just has to be accepted. The boarding and unboarding times are excessive, and often leave you in fear of missing your connecting flight. I would never pay to fly American, but have to for work. Given the choice Delta is the way to go.   I haven’t flown American Airlines in a few years but I am a regular flyer of other airlines. We didn’t get off to a good start when leaving Las Vegas almost an hour late sitting on the runway waiting. The woman next to me repeatedly tried to let a flight attendant know she urgently needed to use the restroom and was guilted into waiting another 30 min before we finally took off and she was able to go once we reached altitude. The flight attendants ignored passengers who hit the call button and once we finally arrived in charlotte NC for a quick layover 85% of the flight was late to connect to another flight. My flight was scheduled to leave in 5 min by the time we landed and I hurried as fast as possible to a gate that was easily a mile away and I got to the gate 8 min late and they were already gone. I then went to customer service where I was told the next flight I could catch was 6 hrs away and given a new boarding pass. I waited at the gate for a couple of hours and watch several other passengers running and missing connecting flights that were barely closing their doors. The only airline here is American and why they couldn’t hold the plane when they know people are minutes away baffles me. My new flight changed gates three times and I had to continually check my email for updates. It was also delayed another hour so we left even later. Poor customer service and obvious poor scheduling made an already long trip twice as bad. I will never use American Airlines again if I can avoid it.   Hands down some of the most idiotic decisions to have ever been made. Our flight was going great, and we even landed early. We pull into a gate, only to realize the gate is broken. A smart person would go to another gate since you have no idea how long it would take to repair the gate. However, we pull into it and wait. After 2 hours, we finally decide to go to another gate since they do not know how long it will take to get fixed. They literally made all of us passengers sit and wait for 2 hours before doing the common sense thing. Almost all passengers missed their next flight if this was a connecting one.   American airlines has made the decision not to allow refunds despite the current situation with the virus. When changing the date due to the situation they tell me that I have to pay a fee of $ 275 per passenger (we are three people) They tell us that the only way to avoid the fee is if I get a ticket again before March 31st. Explain to me how to choose the date if we are in this situation. However, they will receive multi-million dollar aid arranged by the government, but paid by us. We cannot allow this. Let\\'s take practical action to stop this nonsense.. American airlines ha tomado la decision de no permitir reembolsos pese a la situacion que hoy vivimos con el virus. Al cambiar de fecha debido a la situacion me dicen que tengo que pagar un fee de$275 por pasajeros( somos tres personas) Nos dicen que la unica forma para evitar el fee es si vuelvo a sacar pasaje antes del 31 de Marzo. Expliquenme como escoger la fecha si estamos bajo esta situacion. Sin embargo, van a recibir una ayuda multimillonaria tramitada por el gobierno, pero pagada por nosotros. No podemos permitir esto. Tomemos acciones practicas para parar este sin sentido.   First time flying premium economy and was really excited. I had gotten an email before our trip prompting me to consider upgrading, so I clicked the link to see what the benefits to premium economy were. So many disappointments! 6.5 hour flight and NO meal service, not even a sandwich. Our flight was over 3000 miles and their benefit info said a meal (same as first class menu options) would be served. I suppose that’s COVIDS fault, but this was a huge disappointment. Also, premium economy is supposed to have free drinks including alcohol, but nope, not serving alcohol on my flight either. We also got priority orange stickers on our luggage saying with this ticket our baggage comes out first along with first and business class. Nope! My husband and I were thinking our bags didn’t even make it on the plane because they were nearly the last bags out…290 passengers and only about 15 were left waiting on bags! To be fair, on the return trip our bags were one of the first off the plane. The seats were much larger and reclined much further than coach seats and the extra leg room was nice also. But the little things are huge when you spend the extra to upgrade, and then they’re not delivered. We don’t travel often so this was a big deal to us.  So I fly a lot with AA and achieved their highest frequent flyer level, this isn\\'t about my status but the frequency that I fly. I\\'m currently sitting on a flight waiting to depart CLT and again no announcements or apologies. In fact quite the opposite. I board with group 1 and the flight attendant is telling everybody to hurry up because it\\'s not the airlines fault it\\'s late. So who\\'s fault is it? I was at the gate on time, previous flight was delayed leaving and gate was occupied, so what about the gate next door? It was open the whole time. It gets worse every single week, the delays the bad attitudes, the lack of professionalism, the indifference to all the passengers. Now I really feel like a number and not a person. AA was never great but it was at par with Delta, now there is a vast difference between the two, no wonder Delta is ranked #2 and AA #9. I\\'m about finished with AA for good, because AA just doesn\\'t care as long as they get their $$$!   I had a layover from American Airlines to spirit airlines and spirit rejected my personal items. So I missed my connecting flight. The layover was 16hrs. So at that point I was livid and ready to go home. I tried to get my flight changed through the company I purchased tickets from. And they told me I was not going to be able to and I wasn’t going to get a refund or a flight back home the same day. Stressed and anxious I asked Bernadette for help as I realized I wasn’t going to get any customer service support from the Spirit Airlines or the booking company. She was able to help me and book a flight for me as well as Barry from ticketing. I cannot stress enough how much American Airlines customer service is FABULOUS! I was able to get a flight home same day! Which I was told was a snow balls chance in hell of getting. I will be only using American Airlines because of this experience! I pride myself on being a loyal customer, thank you American Airlines for all your help and thank you for critical problem solving in such short notice! \\xa0This morning my grandmother and aunt’s digital boarding pass did not match the terminal listed on the app. The employee at DFW was rude and would not even tell my aunt if she was in the right terminal until she went back to the car to get my grandmother with a wheelchair and giant bag to check and no assistance at all. It was extremely difficult and stressful for them and they were treated with disdain. He talked to them like they were ignorant and an inconvenience. I literally cannot express how disgusted I am with the poor customer service and lack of empathy or decency that was experienced. I hope I can always find a flight on another airline and avoid yours forever.   Won\\'t use American Airlines again. I\\'ll drive if there\\'s no other option. Flight had a series of issues. First the plane needed gas, then there was \"something going on we\\'ve never seen before\". At first people were annoyed that the crew was cryptic, then scared, and then finally angry cause it was very evident that the crew did not care. They all acted as if we were over exaggerating that we\\'d been sitting on a motionless for 2 hours with no answers. The entire stewarding part of the crew needs to be retrained in customer service and how to handle a crew. Technical issues are going to happen, but the crew mishandled the situation completely.   Dallas to San Diego. Last American Airlines trip was the worst, now it is getting better for now. Ground still was chaotic as always. But seat was good for a 3 hour flight. No free food was served, but drink service and I am fine with it. No IFE, but use my laptop to watch movies and live TV which is ok enough. Staff was also ok onboard and nothing bad about this flight. This time my AA flight overall was a pleasant enough. Maybe I will fly AA only if routes like this from now on.   I was notified by email less than 24 hrs before I was to board my flight that read \"We\\'re excited to confirm we processed your refund application today\". One thing wrong with that is that I did not cancel the flight. The rep I spoke to could not give me an explanation as to why they cancelled my flight. But he did offer to rebook me and don\\'t you know there was only a First Class seat available for $1300. So the question becomes about the integrity of the American Airlines, did they sell my seat at a higher price? If I was to answer that question I would have to go with yes.   LaGuardia to Savannah. I had seats reserved along with 5 other active duty military members, yet we were kicked off because “there weren’t enough seats” for everyone. We waited for about 2 hours for them to tell us what would happen next. They couldn’t give us a voucher for another flight at another airport for the same day, when we had orders to be back the same night. Instead, we were given separate tickets for early the next morning at 5:55, onto another connecting flight which would not arrive at our destination until 2 pm. Stay away from this airline as even I thought all of the other reviews were exaggerated about this place.   Rubbish transfer in Miami. Both ways. Huge lines, absolute no prioritisation over people who are late. No one around to talk to. No directions. Staff has no clue what is going on. We were late for connecting fight and they dont compensate for hotel as its immigration fault, not theirs.   Our flight was canceled upon arrival. They rebooked the flight for 3 days later. Was rather rude about helping me find a earlier flight. Not to mention that they have lost all of our checked baggage and haven\\'t been able to get that back to me. 6 checked items and 4 of them were frozen fish from our fishing trip. I will never fly with this company again! When I inquired about the baggage I was told it wasn\\'t their issue and that they wouldn\\'t do anything about it. I would walk across country before I fly with this garbage company again.  Overall, it was a terrible experience. My flight was originally scheduled for 10:40pm, but then it was delayed to midnight, a few minutes later it was delayed to 12:30, then 4:00am, and finally 7:30am. By the time we were made aware that the flight was going to leave in the morning, it no longer made logical sense to take a hotel voucher because by the time you would have made it to the hotel, you would have to leave an hour later to make it through TSA, so almost everyone on my flight decided to spend the night at the airport. In return, customer service representatives gave us $12 food vouchers. This is unacceptable. Not to mention, the customer service representatives were in a terrible mood and I do not blame them. They deserve better than having to tell a hundred angry customers back to back that all they can do is give a $12 food voucher. I am disappointed and will not be flying with American again. It is in your best interest to do the same.   Horrible customer service! Missed connecting flight in Dallas due to severe delays. Even though arrived at gate while connecting plane was still waiting departure, they would not allow us to board even though plane remained at gate 30 plus more minutes. There were two few staff to assist customers and aside from offering to book us on the next flight a couple days later from our transfer city, did not offer to assist financially or in any other way such as through lodging or vouchers to book a separate ticket. We tried to pick up luggage so we could move it to another flight we booked, but there wasn\\'t enough staff 5o retrieve our bag from the transfer luggage so we could recheck it in to new airline. While I did eventually receive that bag at our final destination, it took two hours to find staff to assist in retrieving my luggage from baggage claim. To be fair the cabin crew for one flight was nice and so was the pilot. Even though I understand that some events are out of airlines control, it was very clear from this experience that American Airlines does not view customer service as a priority.  I recently had a highly disappointing experience with American Airlines\\' code share partnership with Japan Airlines. As a loyal customer, I had accumulated over 300,000 American Airlines points, but their redemption process left much to be desired. Despite having a substantial number of points, I was unable to use them effectively or receive the benefits I expected. One of the most frustrating aspects of my journey was no seat selection options, particularly when traveling with children. It is unfathomable that an airline of American Airlines\\' stature would not prioritize the comfort and convenience of families. With no control over seat assignments, we were left scrambling to find suitable seats, causing unnecessary stress and discomfort. Adding to my disappointment, there were no options to upgrade, even when I was willing to pay for an upgrade. This lack of flexibility was particularly disheartening considering the length of my journey. Traveling from the USA to Vietnam with a layover in Japan for over 9 hours meant that comfort and quality service were crucial. Unfortunately, American Airlines/Japan Airline failed to deliver on these fronts. To make matters worse, the return trip mirrored the same problems. The absence of reliable customer support was particularly frustrating. There was no one to turn to for assistance or to address our concerns. This lack of accountability and communication left me feeling abandoned and unsupported throughout my entire journey. Furthermore, both of my flights experienced delays during boarding. This additional inconvenience only served to exacerbate an already frustrating experience, leaving me questioning the airline\\'s commitment to punctuality and customer satisfaction. In light of this disappointing experience, I am left wondering about the value of retaining my American Airlines points or why anyone would choose to remain loyal to the airline. The inability to utilize my points effectively and the overall lack of customer-centric services have seriously diminished my trust in American Airlines. I sincerely hope that American Airlines takes these concerns seriously and addresses the numerous issues faced by their passengers. Until they demonstrate significant improvements in their services and customer support, it is difficult to recommend them or have faith in their loyalty program. Please note that this review reflects my personal experience, and others may have had different encounters. However, based on my own journey, I would caution potential travelers to consider these factors before booking a flight with American Airlines or their code share partner, Japan Airlines.   We had to cancel because of covid. Now they don\\'t want to reimburse us. They keep our money, and tell us that we have a year to use the credit. They are stupid for applying the exact same rules than before, and forgetting to include covid in the equation. We didn\\'t cancel by choice. We cannot go anymore because of the pandemic. And it\\'s still gonna be the same in 2021. Their lack of understanding disappoints me greatly and that just shows us that American Airlines doesn\\'t care about their customers. At least Air Canada and Air transat reimbursed their customers. I will never fly with them anymore. And I hope other people will do the same.  No delays with outbound flight to CUN; however, due to the winter storm front that resulted in flight cancellations/delays, are inbound flight to DFW was delayed by 6 1/2 hours. No fault of the airline. Every other air carrier was affected. To American Airlines credit, flash notifications via SMS kept us updated about the delays. Outbound flight was on a B777-200ER premium economy seat. Very comfortable plane with 2-4-2 seating. In bound flight was on 787-9 Dreamliner. Very comfortable premium economy seating. Kudos to the pilots and flight crew. The pilots on both outbound/inbound flights kept us apprised on a regular basis of when we would be out of turbulence caused by a major weather front that brought single digit bone chilling temperatures to North Texas. ICE worked just fine. Started one movie and finished same on inbound flight. Food and beverage is the typical service on domestic flights (snacks and soft drinks).   I left LGA this morning (9-12-22) on flight AA2127 going to DCA & then on to PNS on flight AA1488. There was not much time for a connection at DCA with the initial flight from LGA delayed. However, the folks at DCA held the continuing flight to PNS. Minor inconveniences were sure to surface from those already loaded on the PNS flight. It was ready to roll with people on board, but American did the right thing and held the PNS flight for about a dozen of us (unrelated people). I just wanted to say thanks! This was an extremely kind act for all affected.   The plane shook side to side jiggling us around forcefully for 3 hours. I looked out the window, it was clear and there didn’t seem to be any wind turbulence. After over a full hour, watching the stewardess whisper behind the wall, the pilot announced that the plane was having technical difficulties and said he would have to turn the plane around and land, about an hour or so away, in Phoenix. We landed in Phoenix and we were deplaned. After about an hour, they boarded us back onto the same plane that was having technical difficulties. We sat on the plane for about 20 minutes and then they decided to deplane us again. They boarded us on a different plane and we flew from Phoenix to OKC airport. The lady in the seat next to me started to panic and pray; this is how bad the plane was jiggling us around for three hours. American Airlines is the worst it’s ever bee, and it’s never been that great!! The hardest part was the fact that the pilot did not tell us what was going on For over an hour.   My trip with American Airlines had multiple issues that occurred throughout the day and they were not all weather related as the airline tried to blame it on. I do know that many other planes landed and took off while our plane circle the airport on Flight Aware, before being re-routed to another airport. due to this, the next flight I was placed on was delayed due to an inoperable jetway and then another delay due to the push vehicle not functioning, which had to be disconnected from the plane and have a new one brought in. Then, once finally in Chicago, flight 6030, the plane I was told by one of the AA representatives in Houston that I would be in the first (Priority) standby position, was delayed due to a maintenance issue. This plane was delayed due to a switch on the plane that was malfunctioning. Eventually, it was determined that the repair could not be made and so that flight was switched to another plane at another gate. Once at the new gate, I am told I am in the second standby position and not the first as I was told I would be. As I now mentioned to the attendant at the new gate, I only had limited time to get to the bus terminal to catch the last bus of the night back to Milwaukee, my final destination, if I was not seated on this flight. They advised me I would get a seat and that I should wait until boarding was completed. I was not given a seat on this plane which led to me missing the last bus of the night to Milwaukee. I then went back to an AA representative to find out when was the next flight I could be put on to Milwaukee. I was informed it would be around 1:00 PM on the following day. Of course the expectation (as told to me by AA personnel) was for me to spend the night in the airport waiting for this plane. At this point, I chose to hire an Uber ride back to Milwaukee at a cost of $108.00 plus a tip. So, there were far more things that went on besides a simple weather delay. I was looking for compensation for mechanical breakdowns, my aggravation at being misled by AA personnel and the cost of my Uber ride. AA then offered me a $25.00 voucher for use on my next flight with them, along with an explanation that this was all their policies would allow for. I typically fly Southwest Airlines and have never experienced such poor customer relations as I did in this instance with American Airlines. From rude gate attendants to all the above mentioned issues and a policy that clearly shows a lack of customer relations, I will never consider using American again.  American has to be one of the worst airlines I have flown, Frontier is probably the only one that is worse, but at least they are transparent about their limitations. They have shown literally no efforts to social distance or keep people separated on their flights. On the same trip I flew Alaskan which made sure that people flying were only sitting in aisle and window seats and that parties were close to each other. Not only did American change my seat about twelve times, they separated my party and had a completely packed plane. Very disappointed American. Will not be flying with this airline again.  Charlotte to Buffalo. Awful! I will never fly American again. They had us sit in their cabin for almost 40 minutes, caused us to almost miss our connecting flight home and then proceeded to lose our luggage. Fly Southwest - they are much better! \\xa0 \\xa0I recently had an experience with American Airlines that truly reaffirmed my loyalty to their services. On Monday, 11/13/2023, I accidentally left my bag on the economy bus after a flight and didn\\'t realize it until four days later. The subsequent hour of frantic calls and coordination was a testament to the exceptional customer service provided by American Airlines. What impressed me the most was the efficiency with which my bag was recovered and returned to me. Thanks to the tag on my bag that identified it as mine, the bag was promptly located and brought back into the airline\\'s possession. This incident highlighted the dedication and commitment of American Airlines to ensuring the well-being of their passengers and their belongings. The seamless coordination between the different departments involved in this process showcased a well-organized and customer-centric approach. The fact that I only fly American Airlines speaks volumes about the reliability and trustworthiness I have come to associate with this airline. In an industry where hiccups can occur, it\\'s the response and resolution that truly matter, and American Airlines went above and beyond to rectify the situation swiftly and with utmost professionalism. This incident has solidified my confidence in American Airlines, and I will continue to choose them for my future travels.   Jacksonville to Lynchburg. Long story made short. I had trip credit from previous trip that they messed up that’s why I had credit. Went to use my credit for a trip and I got to the airport to find out that they had canceled my trip and said it was my banks fault. They said my bank disputed the charge of $13.80 which was the difference of the trip credit I had to pay. My bank can’t dispute a charge unless I request a dispute. I had to purchase another ticket for more cost. I was trying to go home to my cousins funeral so I had to purchase a ticket. American Airlines made my trip worst. They refuse to give me my credit on another ticket saying it’s my banks fault. My bank sent me the email of the transaction. American Airlines lied. Never again will I. I will crawl first. \\xa0\\xa0Used to love this Airline, \\r\\n not so much anymore. Flight from MYR to ORD: passengers squeezed like sardines! I’m only 5,5” size 8/10 and I had next to no legroom, no space at all between passengers for elbows.  I can’t imagine if my son 6’ 200lbs off muscles would fit in those seats and that in the times of pandemic!! Pitch to recline virtually nonexistent. To top it off, the flight attendants went on a 5 minute Spiel of credit card selling, afterwards a prerecorded sales pitch, then before deplaning they came around with applications. Did I really pay to be forced to listen to infomercials I couldn’t mute? And in some variations that happened on all 6 flights! The last flight (CLT to MYR), the flight attendants seemed extremely bored/bothered - before deplaning they came with trash bags, not sure what for since there was no snack/drink offered. \\r\\n As I got on my last flight, I overheard a flight attendant thanking the pilot for helping clear up a situation, a passenger to a different destination made it onto that flight… In ORD they took my carryon and said it would be there when I get off the plane, well it wasn’t, on top of that I was rushed off the bridge which meant I couldn’t get my luggage until “everybody” got off the plane and the gate agent went to retrieve it. This gate agent was very rude.  I barely made my connection and didn’t have a chance to pick up dinner until I got home. Lastly, the app is useless and only worked on 2 off 6 flights, couldn’t check in or get boarding passes on it! Couldn’t connect to in flight entertainment/wifi, not sure why, not that I could’ve used it since you need the old plug in headphones. Would’ve been nice to know at point of sale so I could’ve bought some of those outdated things. Other than that and the last 2 flight attendants/pilots/ground personnel was friendly and professional. The planes were dirty, trays/armrests, windows don’t seem to get cleaned between flights, Unfortunately this means, I am not looking forward to flying with them anytime soon again. The unpleasant experience left me wondering if I was flying one of those bare bone discount airlines.Very disappointing! Wish I could give zero stars for some…   American Airlines time and time again proves why they’re ranked “the worst airline in America.” AA’s customer service policies are simply horrendous. My flight out of DCA was delayed, causing me to miss my connecting flight in Chicago. AA claimed the delay was unavoidable, despite it stemming from AA’s poor planning regarding Labor Day weekend air traffic. I was rebooked for the next morning, but offered no hotel, no meals, no voucher, nothing. To make matters worse, only God knows where my checked bag is. Do yourself a favor and fly with a different airline. AA makes Spirit look good.   Our outgoing flight was delayed three times and then actually boarded later than the last delayed sent by message. We got on board hoping to have a beverage, but the cabin lights were turned off and no stewards showed up during entire flight. The heat in the cabin was excessively hot. On our return flight, we took the Airbus to our designed gate for our connecting flight at DFW. The gate was changed - back on the airbus to a new gate, another delayed flight, another gate change. I was disappointed in AA.   Horrible experience. I fly frequently and I only have issues when I fly with American Airline. Currently I\\'ve been trying to get a refund on baggage for a flight that was canceled about 3 months ago. I\\'ve sent multiple emails and have been told that someone will get back to me eventually. Well it\\'s been 3 months and I want my money. Not to mention that our flight experience was canceled multiple times and eventually we had to fly with a different airline. It literally was delayed for two days. Literally went back to the airport 3 times to be turned away and have to come back later. And no one at the desk cared at all! This is not the first time I’ve dealt with something like this from American Airlines. The absolute worst company.   Checked in online as soon as they allowed it and got seated 5 rows away from my partner. We purchased our tickets together so why they split us up I don’t understand. Then had to purchase upgrade to get seated together. I was out in the middle seat meaning two strangers sitting on either side of me meaning they are probably traveling alone and did not need to be seated anywhere specific. Also the flight was full plus a bunch of kids which is fine but during this pandemic you want to set with your family not strangers. I contacted the customer relations department and they literally said well seat assignments are created when you check in well ok but why when we both checked in at the same time can we not sit together. It’s just annoying that we have to go out of our way to find seats near each other when seating should be based on the tickets purchases together. Our ticket numbers were one digit apart.   Four of us had a direct flight to Greenville to Washington. Flight left at 1031 getting into DC at 1149. Attendant notified us that they overbooked and only 2 of us could go. We were told they were waiting on 2 more people to check in before we could have their seat. We waited for them to make an announcement for volunteers but only heard them call 2 people names. 1 didn\\'t volunteer and the other didn\\'t show. We were told 1 volunteered which was the no show so that was a lie. We had asked for manager, who eventually came to the gate when the flight was closed. He never identified himself as a manager and us asking for him several times. We were finally told who he was. After over a hour of going back and forth, they made ground transportation arrangements for us to go to Charlotte, NC and leave at 605pm and arrive in DC at 725.   American Airlines has become the worse airline to fly with. Canceled our flight last minute do to over booking, had attitude and were unapologetic when we tried to find alternate flights. Flight attendant spilled hot coffee on me during the flight and didn\\'t even Apologize until we landed. They somehow didn\\'t put our checked bags under the plane and now we\\'re getting nowhere trying to track the bags down. None of their employees we\\'ve encountered have any idea what customer service is. This airline is a joke and we will never fly with them again.   Second time flying with American Airlines over the last month and they are just terrible. I don’t know what’s going on with their jets, but they may be due for an upgrade considering how they’re always needing maintenance that causes canceled flights or delays them by 4+ hours. The staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. Why are they even still in business at this point? Their jets are falling apart and outdated, poor customer service, horrible food/snacks. You would think I was flying with Spirit. No thank you. However, the terrible service from AA has made me appreciate Delta even more.   Flight was delayed therefore I would\\'ve missed my connecting flight in Charlotte. The airline rebooked my flight without confirming the flight change with me. AA never took my bags off the original flight so now my bags are stuck in Charlotte and I\\'m on my way to Chicago then Vegas. None of the representatives at the airport knows what they\\'re doing and seem all over the place. AA has a bad reputation for constant flight delays with no compensation. I definitely will never fly through American Airlines again and I will recommend that others do the same. You attempt to leave a day early and AA will still find a way to delay your flight.   Absolutely horrible! I flew out of Portland en route to Louisville. Landed in DC, landed at 718 pm, didn\\'t get off of the plane until 745 due to a \"gate mixup\". Missed my next flight and also my ride. So the next flight out was the following morning. They did put me up in a hotel, least they could do, the next morning I go to customer service to make sure I was at the right gate. A lady finally strolls out after 5-10 minutes of waiting, and totally blows me off. I took a pic of the customer service desk, showing no one behind the counter, and several of us in line. This is ridiculous. Since I missed my flight last night, I also have to be out $200 for an Uber. American Airlines should reimburse me. I highly suggest that you or any one you care about should fly with a different airline.   I\\'m flying on average 12-15 times a year with different domestic and international airlines but never had such horrible experience like I had lately with American Airlines. They are liars and hypocrites cause they say different things over the phone and totally different in person, were they want me to pay $100 extra for the checked box containing only full size 29\" bicycle which weighted 51.7 Lbs. then forced me to ripped everything apart in the middle of the airport and remove pedals, seat, calipers and brake pads so it\\'s weight was within 50 Lbs. Staff at the gate was horrible threatening to charge me another $100 for my carry-on which had to had all the extra parts I was forced to remove from checked box placed in it. On my way back, flight from DFW to DEN was delayed over 4 hours and 3 different gate changes but there was not even a single word of apology.   Flight left Cabo late. Arrived in Charlotte for connecting flight with maybe 15 minutes to spare! Bags didn’t get on belt until 8pm and flight was for 8.15! Now mind you all of this is out of our control. Get to hate at 819 to be told we are too late. Go to get another flight and find out we are stranded until the next day at 9. Now get this…. With no accommodation. Like it’s your fault that we missed our flight and you don’t have any accommodation. I recommend you use them only if you have to because they really don’t care. And then the lady at the counter act like we were inconveniencing her with her little attitude.   It’s always something with AA. Delays, mechanical issues, you name it. Every time I fly AA I say “this is the last time”. Shame on me. If I ran my business the way AA runs theirs I would have to shut down. I wish Southwest Airlines would just buy up all the other airlines. Nothing compares to their customer experience. How does AA stay in business? Supply and demand I suppose. Oh well, I would highly recommend not flying AA. You are better off driving, even if it takes an extra day. If you do choose to fly AA, pack a toothbrush and some clean undies in your carry on. You’re gonna need em!   Flight from CHO to CLT delayed. Options for Wed with app out of CHO. Unacceptable. Spoke with 3 reps before getting my flight changed where I would only miss 5 hours of work. This is the only bright side to this. I was booked on another flight. Booked hotel in CLT due to new delay. Plane arrived and gate rep informed us plane needed maint. informed flight landing at midnight be used to CLT. Then informed no go and the only option AA could give us was to leave on Wednesday. Ppl jumped to the line to get it worked out. After 30-40 minutes of two sets of passengers getting it worked out, I decided to make the 4.5 hour drive to CLT before it got too late. I needed to make my connecting flight to get to work Monday! Price gouging is allowed and thriving at airports, as the rental attendant informed me it would be $316 for a vehicle. Enterprise charge dbl if they had vehicles! Called cust service again and while on the phone, boarding was called at the gate I was just at where gate attendant had informed us not 50 minutes earlier that we stuck until Wednesday and on our own. Of course, myself and other passengers who were lining up other means were not allowed back to the gate as TSA was closed.  I cannot express the frustration, anger, stress, and fuming hatred I have towards your airline. I was informed to request a refund for the flight and make a complaint for reimbursement of expenses and there was a note for the refund. At the airport I was not surprised there was in fact no note in my records for a refund. If I never fly this airline again it will be too soon!   My initial flight, from Palm Springs, CA, to Dallas, TX, was delayed 35 minutes. I only made my connecting flight because my deboarding gate and boarding gate were next to each other in Dallas. Upon closing up the Dallas, TX to Tampa, FL flight our plane taxied for a bit, then stopped for 1 hr 10 minutes while we waited for American Airlines to try to fix a malfunctioning light in the cockpit. When it was decided the light wouldn\\'t be fixed we returned to our gate and were told to leave the plane. Then we waited 20 minutes in the terminal and then were told to take the train across the airport to another terminal and gate. There we waited 20 minutes upon which we were told to take another train to another terminal. There we waited 20 minutes upon which we were again told to take another train to another terminal. There we waited another 20 minutes and finally boarded our plane. Then we sat for 45 minutes as we were initial told our co-pilot was sent to another flight and another would have to be found for our flight. Then, after waiting in the plane for another co-pilot to be found, we were then told we were not waiting for our initial co-pilot to be sent back to our flight (his initial flight). Then, after he finally arrived, our plane taxied for a bit and stopped upon which we were told we now had a 20-minute weather delay for a \"weather cell\" to pass. Over an hour later we finally took off. We arrived 2am in Tampa, approx 6 hours late. Due to this I missed my morning shift ($200) and work and had to pay for an extra night for my dog at the kennel ($75). I relayed all of this to American Airlines and they responded with a $75 voucher for further travel. I replied that this was hardly acceptable to which they replied, basically, \"too bad.\"  Dallas to Cancun via Newark. This is the worst airline ever. I was waiting at Dallas airport waiting for my flight when there were 7 delays. The first delay was because the plane wasn\\'t here yet. The second delay was that the hanger had a big problem. The third delay was that it was the same situation. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth delay was the same. Finally, the plane arrived at the airport. We got on the plane and there was a super long line. It took forever to call from group to group. I was in group 9. In the middle of the flight, They served food and beverage which was fine right before we were landing, they ran out of choices.   Tickets for my flight were oversold, we arrived on time but we couldn\\'t board the plane. I was offered to fly with my daughter tomorrow and my mother on Thursday 2/23 because there weren\\'t 3 seats available. But I was told to keep checking in case someone canceled. I called back tonight twice. The 2nd time because there was a seat available online. But it was first class and if I chose to change it I would have to pay the difference bc it would be a \"voluntary change\". But changing my two tickets to Thursday could be done because is not first class, but we would only have 5 days left in Cuba, because i only have a 7 day vacation. The lady on the phone reminded me of the checks we got at the airport for the \"inconvenience\" but those don\\'t pay for the costs of missing work, rentals in Cuba, family waiting in the airport, etc. My mother gets anxious when flying alone and needs help with the bags. It is very aggravating to know that there is an option for her to flight to Miami tomorrow but since it is first class she can\\'t have it unless she pays more when all of this is happening bc of the airline in the first place.   I showed up to get a gate pass for an unaccompanied minor. I stood in line for an hour. 2 attendants were working and one attendant was with the same customer for 50 minutes. The other attendant let a lady cut the line and proceeded to help her for 15 minutes delaying everybody that was already waiting. I finally went up there and asked the attendant who was helping the family for 50 minutes if he could help me in which he did. Once I made it through security I was at a random gate trying to verify I was at the right gate to retrieve my daughter and the attendant starts yelling at everybody that they need a break and hands out some paper. I argued that I need to know which gate considering my daughter\\'s plane is almost here and someone finally help me. Most ridiculous service I\\'ve ever seen all around.   I\\'m lifetime GOLD (not that means anything to AA). Booked a Business trip from 6/23 ~ 6/27 using credits from previous business tickets purchase pre-pandemic. I\\'m in a wheelchair so always fly first class to be at the front of the plane. Flight cancelled today, rebooked me in economy on earlier flight. Have booked a Southwest flight as backup. On hold AA Gold Desk as for 55 minutes as of this posting. My recommendation, fly SW for domestic, find another carrier for international.   I’ve flown with AA before so I know they aren’t my favorite. Dismissive staff and mediocre service, the prices aren’t anything to swoon over either. Today my flight was canceled because they were “short one flight attendant”. Is there no one else they can call in? Do they not have sufficient staffing to run their airline? Super disappointing. Luckily I had a one way stop but others had connections they wouldn’t be making and were scheduled for the next day or week! Absolutely ridiculous. Never booking with them again.  I had flight credit for a trip I had cancelled March of 2020, since covid had begun. This is my second time flying with American Airlines but I will never be flying again. 2 Checked bags for $70? Ridiculous. Basically paid $70 to have eyeshadow palettes broken inside (which cost way more than the baggage fee) my suitcase even though I had tightly secured and wrapped them. We were supposed to land in PBI at 6 pm, but the weather was bad in our connecting flight city (Dallas). None of the customer representatives were helpful in explaining that if I hadn’t changed my flight I would still make it around 8 pm since all flights were delayed in and out of Dallas. So we ended up leaving at 2.30 pm after staying in the SLC airport since 7 am that morning. We then got to Dallas and didn’t leave till around 11 pm. Flying into Florida at 3.30 am. There were no ubers or lyfts available, and I was alone with my other friend. Two young girls under the age of 19, is quite terrifying flying into a city at 3.30 with no option but a taxi. We were yelled at by the taxi driver because apparently we had “woken him up” for a 10 minute drive to our hotel. Someone had also thrown my ipad during security bypass and it shattered, so that’s wonderful. And you can’t even reach American Airlines on the phone to tell them and try to get your money back.   Kona to Vermont via Los Angeles. This was awful. Rude staff and sat apart from the person I booked tickets with while there was space to seat us together. The planes are antiquated and this airline is the worst. I will avoid American Airlines at all cost in the future.  Had my flight get delayed over night with no explanation and the crew left immediately. I was not given a meal or hotel voucher. On another flight I have a layover of 12 hours. There are 4 other flights of the same airline going to the same destination this morning and I cannot switch because I am basic economy! American Airlines is the absolute worst.   Come on American! Get your act together. After numerous delays for weather, we waited on the plane for an hour prior to take off while waiting for a mechanic to bring a log to the pilot. Unacceptable given everyone had already waited through delays.   I could not imagine a worse customer service. We have been on hold for 5 hours today and we submitted a call back request 8 hours ago. We need to get a different flight and we were told on the Chat service to cancel our flight and use the credit towards the purchase of a new flight. This is the same information they have on the web site. When we canceled the flight we did not receive a credit for our tickets. Instead, we received no credit and the online system tells us to call customer service which does not exist at American Airlines. Only in America could a business be this bad and still survive.  Experience was terrible! Flight delayed with NO notice 24 plus hours, no whereabouts on bags and provided $12 DOLLARS for food for a whole day. DISGRACED to say the least. Food also terrible and minimum leg room. We’re only provided a hotel room 100 plus kms away with no transport. Got stuck in LAX with no clothes, belonging etc and were stranded. So thank you so much American Airlines for your APPALLING service!  American Airlines itself is a decent airline, but the fact that approx. 5 - 7% of their flights are direct flights is a capital crime. Almost every trip requires a connection, with about 85 - 90% of those connections being in Charlotte. It is kind of funny that lot of the budget airlines, like Spirit & Frontier among others offer a majority of direct travel all across Canada & The US. How is American Airlines not jumping on this. Honestly, a stopover is not bad, especially if you love flying, like I do. However with American, a stopover is a bittersweet thing. Firstly, a stopover could be anywhere 40 minutes to 1 hour. Hearing that you initially think \"OK, not bad at all\" then you have your first flight delayed for a bogus reason, rendering your connection pointless, which is frustrating. Frustration increases usually because with American Airlines, your first flight will be an evening flight, and after the delay, you get to your connection 1 hour late if not more, and you have to stay all night in the airport to get your connecting flight first thing in the morning. Yay! If you are lucky to get a representative at a ticket booth, which will be few & far between if that, you will be given some sort of miss-information in regards to why your flight was delayed. After finding out that upgrading my seat from aisle to window, would be $54, US as well. That\\'s fun! American Airlines screws up and still wants to charge for trying to rectify the situation. Like us customer are the inconvenience. After saying no, I actually had a representative tell me \"You can certainly book a flight with United\" what kind of answer is that. Your airline messes up and your advice is have a customer pay more money with a different airline. Alright then! WiFi on American is not the best either, unless you are a Xfinity or Verizon member. If not, don\\'t expect any internet access besides the American Airlines site allowing you to check other American Airlines flights to see your connecting flight is on time and knowing you will miss it. Prices for WiFi on the airline range from $15 - $20, just to use the WiFi on 1 device only. Oh Joy! I do realize airlines screw up sometimes, it\\'s a part of travel. The whole \"it\\'s about the journey, not the destination\" thing. However, at least have the decency to be honest with customers about what is going on and try to accommodate them. The very least you can do is try to keep the customer. At least with your own airline. As much as I love flying, a direct flight is certainly better than this headache I endured. American, please get your stuff together. Remember, you are not the only airline in the skies. Simply put, I almost missed a friend\\'s wedding because of the American Airlines headache.   I am amazed that this airline can keep in business. I flew Delta to my destination, but AA on the way back. Never again. Don’t care if Delta charges a bit more, AA is that bad in comparison. I have a horrible back from 21+ years of military service which prevents me from sitting in a chair for a time. So I was standing up by the back lavatories. Some male flight attendant rudely told me that I posed some kind of “safety hazard” in doing so. I suppose he didn’t care for my presence and invading his space. I am well aware of the dangers associated with being out of my seat without the seatbelt secured, but why would one make such a statement without knowing the reasoning? On international flights, I have hung out in the same spot for 85% of the flight and had great times conversing with the flight attendants. Nope not AA! Furthermore, both these flights required passengers to check their carry on’s at the gate. What? I’ve been flying since I was knee high and have never experienced this. Very poor quality all around. Considering that this is just the service and such shortcuts are taken, what other shortcuts are being taken that we don’t know about (plane functionality, flight checks, etc). No thank you for me. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.   I am very disappointed with my experience with American Airlines today. It has been a disaster from the start when I booked with them. They changed my tickets two times with out my notice. I paid for a non stop flight but they changed us to connecting flights with out our approval. When we called to address this they were not helpful or friendly it seemed we was bother them. Not to mention it took us forever to get them on the phone. But the worse part is I made a error spelling my Boyfriends last name and they refused to correct it or allow me to change it. While trying to board they stopped us and told us we had to purchase entirely additional tickets due to a simple mistake of the name changing. They charged us a Additional 675.00. This is high way robbery and down right wrong. They took advantage because we were desperate and time was not on our side. We ended up paying them a 675.00 extra dollars for no good reason. This airline is a rip off and a joke. I would recommend no one to use American Airlines. I had the worse experience in my last life and it could have all been fixed with one stroke of the keyboard. While I’m sitting on the plane now it’s overcrowded , we got harassed by the flight attendant because we booked two tickets for the same person, not even they could understand it. I am on flight AA4443. Never again you couldn’t pay me to fly with American Airlines.   I am 80 years old and recently suffered a major medical event while fishing in Corpus Christi and spent a week in ICU. After I was released, I was too weak to drive back home to Lubbock, so I booked a one-way ticket on American Airlines and paid for First Class and wheelchair assistance the whole way because I am unable to walk more than a few feet at a time. I got on the plane in Corpus, and he made it to Dallas just fine, but that is when all hell broke loose. First, the AA staff abandoned me in my wheelchair, and I had to rely on the help of kind strangers to help me get to the next gate. I had a two-hour layover, but the flight was delayed (no explanation). Then I was told he had to go to another gate, and again AA staff abandoned me and left me sitting in a wheelchair. Fortunately, another kind stranger helped me get to the new gate. Then, that flight was delayed as well. Eight hours later, at 1:30 am, AA announced the flight had been canceled but did not tell me about it. I am sound of mind, but at my age, I do not do well with smartphones and email, which is how AA notifies people these days. AA canceled my flight and his ticket and just left me sitting in a wheelchair in the DFW airport at 1:30 am. I had to call my son at 1:30 am and have him look things up online and tell me what was going on. He found that AA had booked me a room at a hotel, but I would have to travel via shuttle miles from the airport to get there, and I had no way to even get to the shuttle, even if I knew where to go. Thank God for more kind strangers that helped me get there. When I got to the hotel, the clerk at the hotel was the meanest person I have ever met. He was shouting and yelling at everyone. He was screaming at me that I had to show him the code AA had sent me for the hotel. As I said, I am not good with smartphones and did not know how to find what he wanted.  I had to call my son again at 2:30 am to have him help me. He texted me a screenshot of the code and asked me to hand my phone to the clerk so he could see it. My son asked the man to understand my situation and help me, but the clerk started shouting at my son and told me that if I did not show him the code, I would have to leave the hotel. I have never seen such horrible service. Afterward, I found out that AA commonly uses this Atrium hotel for canceled flights, and this is not an uncommon occurrence that tired travelers are treated like this at this hotel. My son has contacted the owner of the hotel about my treatment by this clerk, demanding an apology.  AA booked me on another flight the next day at 1:00 pm. I had paid for a First Class aisle seat at the front of the plane, but they stuck me at the very back of the plane in a window seat. Again, they offered me no wheelchair assistance or help of any kind.   Two of my flights were delayed and because of that we lost our international flight. There was a lot of misleading information, rudeness, and terrible costumer service. If you booked economy class be prepared to be treated like “this is what you paid for.” No respect at all to their customers. They put us in a poor hotel, they gave us a meal voucher of $12, and car transportation (which was the only nice thing). This was my first and last time flying AA.   The most horrific experience of my life. Left home for schedule flight at 3am, only for a delay until 1047. That ended up delayed until 2pm. The gates continually changed, missing all of the rescheduled flights. Ended up in wonderful LA Guardia, but my luggage is now in JFK.   I use American Airlines because they are the only airline that has a non-stop flight from San Diego to Miami that allows unattended minors. I fly my two young teenagers back and forth from their Mother to me their Father. Recently (November) we arrived to the airport 2.5 hours early as requested. Once I got up to the counter to check them in, I told the attendant that my two minors were 12 and 14 and were flying unattended. She gave me a dirty look and said, \"where are their ID\\'s?\". I explained to her again they were minors and did not have an ID. She goes, \"where is their paperwork you are supposed to fill out?\" I told her she had it and I always filled it out at the counter because it wasn\\'t available online. She glared at me and then got the paperwork and handed it to me. I asked her if she had a pen I could use. She goes, \"We\\'re in the middle of a pandemic, we don\\'t have that stuff\" I told her I didn\\'t bring one because I wasn\\'t sure if I could take it through security and it had never been a problem in the past, I\\'ve flown them many times since the pandemic started. She scolded me again for not having a pen and then stormed off. I don\\'t know where she went but she came back about 5 minutes later. She then turned to the attendant at the next counter and asked to borrow her pen. The attendant handed her a pen and she gave it to me. I filled out the paperwork and gave it back to her. She printed the gate pass for me and the boarding passes for my two children. She has them in her hand and then says, \"Oh we have a problem here\", \"You haven\\'t paid for their trip\". She was dead serious. I immediately pulled up my email with the trip confirmation and receipt. She didn\\'t even look at it but goes, \"ok\". Then hands me the passes. I feel like this woman was intentionally trying to bait me into causing a scene or getting mad and yelling (I felt like it on the inside but wasn\\'t gonna give her the satisfaction). My two children were right there next to me watching all of this. When they fly out it\\'s already a sad and nervous time for them because they are flying alone and leaving their father. It was truly appalling and gross. This kind of behavior is not acceptable. This women made it 10 times worse for them and just left a really bad vibe. I was polite to her from start to finish for the sake of my children. If i didn\\'t ever have to use AA ever again I wouldn\\'t Unfortunately I am stuck. The tickets are not cheap either they cost me between 1200 and 1500 for a round-trip.  We were held captive on the plane for 6 hours and never left JFK airport. Never offered food or drink. After 6 hours held hostage told to get off flight cancelled for no reason. No flight given to me to get to my vacation. I paid $2600 for a vacation I never got to have. Fighting everyday for AA to refund my tickets. Lost money on my Hotel and Rental car. Their people are rude and do not care. I will never ever fly again after this horrible experience and losing $2600.   American airlines is hands-down the worst airline from a First World country. I vowed never to fly them once before, and after many years I decided to fly them again. My bags were lost for five days and they couldn’t find them even though we had a tracker in the bag telling us exactly where the bags were. On my flight home, I was met with the most ridiculous set of circumstances that prevented me from using my miles to upgrade from premium economy to business. They had the inventory, they just wouldn’t do it because apparently the premium economy ticket I bought wasn’t the right type of ticket. After spending an hour and 10 minutes on the phone, I was connected to a supervisor who repeatedly talked over me to repeat herself telling me why they could not upgrade me. These people are terrible.   I write this as I sit on the airplane. We have been on the ground for 45 minutes and my connecting flight boards in an hour. You may ask why we are sitting here on the plane still and it’s because there is “no open gates” however in my current line of sight I see 8. Thanks American Airlines. You have now made me late. Didn’t expect anything else from this pitiful excuse of service.   During airplane boarding, the display screen showed incorrect information (said Group 2 out of 9 now boarding) even though they were \"inviting all passengers to board.\" Given that information, I waited, expecting Group 2 to reach 5 momentarily. Next thing you know, the boarding gate closed and the plane was already taking off, I asked the AA agents there why they had not updated the screen and if they could let me through because I thought it was not my turn yet logically because of the screen information. They apologized and said they couldn\\'t do anything, they even tried to blame it on me for not coming to the gate. Well, now I missed that flight and my ticket is not refundable — terrible experience with AA. I\\'ve been a loyal AA customer for some time now but this is really off-putting and demotivating for future travel. All I can say now is don\\'t fly with AA — use Delta Airlines instead where they can actually process a refund in a case like this.   Prior to booking this first class ticket I confirmed with American there were dedicated flight attendants for the few seats in First Class and they were strictly monitoring and enforcing mask wearing. On my flight, the passenger next to me, kept taking his mask off. The flight attendant knew him and kept stopping to chat with him and also served him 8 huge glasses of Chardonnay, despite the fact he was visibly intoxicated. She even opened a fresh bottle at his request as we were landing. When I asked the flight attendant to enforce the mask policy she first told me she did not notice he wasn\\'t wearing a mask, which is so lacking in credibility as she stopped at least 20 times to chat with him. When I confronted her on this she laughed in my face. I sent a complaint to American today and received a form email back reciting the law and how seriously American takes it. Do not fly American. They do not care about their passengers and do not enforce their own policies or the law.  Yet again, American Airlines, delivers on their abhorrent customer service. I haven’t flown with them in over 6 years due to constant issues with flights (delays, last minute changes or cancellations - usually due to their error). I recently decided to fly with them due to someone else picking up the tab and they re-affirmed why I stopped flying with them. They cancelled my red eye via text last minute. I had to call and fight to get them to change it to one with Delta that would work with my schedule (4 hours longer). When I asked for any customer service, I was told I chose this flight so they aren’t liable. They told me that all they’re responsible for is getting me to my destination, but apparently they get to choose the time and flight for me ultimately.   I flew my son down for my wedding and he had a horrible experience. He was so delayed out of Rochester NY on his incoming flight that he missed his connecting flight in Charlotte and no other flights to Columbia were available that day per American Airlines so I had to drive 2hrs to Charlotte to pick him up. On his return flight American Airlines informed him that he could fly from Columbia SC to Charlotte NC, but his connecting flight in Charlotte was canceled and would have to stay there till the following day. We called American Airlines customer care center and got no resolve. We drove to Columbia SC airport and spoke with a ticket agent and got no resolve. As a matter of fact, the ticket agent was rather rude and had a grin on her face which only rubbed salt in a wound. My son is a Veteran and deserved so much more respect than this. I am a paying customer and deserved better than this. In the end my son ended up having to drive back to NY. I paid almost $600 dollars for his tickets and American Airlines did not live up to their obligations. I will never use American Airlines. This is not good customer care, this is not how you conduct business.  Terrible customer service at the boarding gate, literally ignoring all passengers in line for upwards of 30 minutes. I was sitting and just watching the frustration grow on everyone\\'s faces. Our own issue was that within 45 minutes of boarding they announced the flight was delayed 56 minutes, so our flight will land after our connection leaves. They rebook us on an awful redeye connection (with two toddlers how fun) through another airport. Then shortly later the delayed plane arrives maybe 5 minutes late? How can they announce a 56 minute departure delay when the plane was only a few minutes out, and it was not due to ground issues they turned that plane around super fast. End of the day the plane actually leaves basically on time, we would of made our connection but because of gate attendants that totally just ignore a line of customers. We were stuck on a terrible flight. We were not the only ones this happened to obviously.   I was flying from Calgary to Milwaukee on November 1st. After waiting at the airport for 10 hours because our 6.44am flight kept getting delayed, it was finally cancelled. After rescheduling to the next day, they would not let us get our bags, for another 2 hours. During the whole day, there was no communication provided to any of us passengers. We were all missing connections, and no one was helping us. A few of us even tried to get on other flights, but they would not removed our bags from the \"broken airplane\" and put them on the other flights, further leaving us stuck at the airport. The next day, the flight was once again, delayed for over 5 hours. Again, no communication to us about the delays except for the messages we were getting on the app. Not only did I miss work, I was not given a food voucher or hotel voucher. I contacted American Airlines, where they gave me a $50 flight voucher. I told them that was not an acceptable resolution, for being stuck at the airport for over 15 hours in two days. According to my passenger rights, I am entitled to compensation, but they will not provide that and have stopped responding to my emails. I do not recommend flying with them, especially after the poor lack of service trying to remediate the situation.   I don’t know how to put into words the absolute misery American Airlines inflicts on passengers with impunity. They delayed my flight from Dallas Fort Worth to Seattle 4 times. The flight was at 10:30 pm, then 11:15, then 11:30, then 12:30, then 1:30 am and then they announced it was cancelled and had to move everyone to the 10:30 am flight the next day. Some people at ticketing said the issue was weather. This is patently false because other flights are making it out just fine. Another said they had no pilots. I am not sure that they will even have pilots for the rescheduled flight, yet on their website they are selling the same flight at an earlier time. The airport here in Dallas is absolutely littered with folks whose flights have been cancelled and have been stranded here because of American’s absolute idiocracy. I vow to never fly with them again and plan to tell anyone and everyone in my circle to avoid this airline. It’s absolutely disgusting how they continue to get away with these actions on this scale.   Every time I have flew with this airline this year it has been a disaster. First go round we had a 12 hour delay because they were understaffed. The second time we were an hour early we stood in line because we didn’t have definite seats. Literally waited the whole time all for them to say the flight was closed when we got up to the counter. I will never fly with them again. On top of no one knows what’s going on when you ask questions. Who wants to deal with all that stress to get home after a vacation where your suppose to be relieving stress. They won’t accommodate you when they’re totally in the wrong.   Do not recommend flying with American Airlines. Save your money & fly any other airline. Awful customer service and refuse to help. Canceled 2 flights with no answers or accommodations.  They delayed the flight several times, then right before entering the plane they took away mine and several other passengers’ carry-on, saying that there was no room left inside the plane. Then when I arrived at Fort Lauderdale airport they didn\\'t give me my carry-on. They lost it. Absolutely unorganized work, poor service, uncomfortable plane and these small seats for $300, no free Wi-Fi.  This is the absolute worst airline I have ever corresponded with. The staff on call is rude and impatient. I had booked a flight with a friend which got cancelled due to Covid. They gave us credits at the time. Later on when we tried to book our flights, she got her credits and I didn\\'t. I told them this is ridiculous how can you treat two people in the exact same position differently and all I got was long holds on call and the most generic and annoying email replies of my life. NEVER FLY AA!!   This review isn\\'t so much about American Airlines as it is about a flight attendant. As we all know, since 911, and more recently Covid, traveling has changed in countless ways. However, one flight attendant, Jan, brought back the joy of flying on my flight from Portland to Dallas. From her greeting upon boarding & throughout the flight, she was professional, kind, personable, attentive to the souls on board, and always with a beautiful smile. It felt as though the years had slipped away, and we were once again in a time when our world had not been forever changed. Thank you, Jan. And thank you American Airlines for having such an amazing person working for you!! The flight was 2655 on Wednesday, January 25th - I was seated in 21C.   Started out in Knoxville airport where something was wrong with the plane, but instead of telling us what was going on, the agent called up a few people at a time to rebook even though I was in line first because I knew something was wrong. Then, finally when the agent, who was extremely obnoxious with her stupid happy smirk, overly positive typing skills and repeatedly saying “Spring has Spruuung”, gave me a ticket to Charlotte where I’d be on standby for my next flight. (Pretty much just to get me outa her hair). In Charlotte, I ended up going to the help desk where an agent got me a legit ticket in like one minute. It was the same flight where the agent had put me on standby after typing for twenty minutes. Then the 4 people on standby who all showed up at the last minute ended up with seats in aisles 8 & 9 while I’m back in last aisle. I can’t stand this airline. I wish the company cared about its reviews, its customers, peoples comfort, and kept up with maintenance on their planes but all they care about is money. You really should just be shut down.  This was a final leg of our trip back home. We had traveled from Orlando to LA, LA to Maui. During our trip we traveled from Maui to Oahu back to Maui. Then then I\\'ll return trip We went from Maui to LAX. During all parts of our trip, our entire family traveled with only carry-on bags and never had any issues until at LAX when a gate attendant decided to single us out and decide that one of our bags was too large. When I attempted to address the issue with him, he was overtly rude and dismissive and literally shoot me away with his hand to go away. I attempted to address my concerns with the airline and was met with a boiler plate cut and paste response.   I have never missed a flight in my life. Have had a nightmare day with American Airlines. I was on a flight through American Airlines going from RDU to FLL that had a short layover in Charlotte. Our initial flight ways delayed about 30 minutes due to \"power outages in the Raleigh area.\" Mind you it was a sunny 72 degree day. Then we were delayed at the gate in Charlotte because of a \"sluggish jet bridge.\" Our connecting flight was scheduled to depart at 4:50 pm and we were not able to deplane until 4:38 pm. Our connecting flight was in a completely different concourse. We ran the entire way. When we arrived at the gate, the gate was closed but the plane had not left yet. We were informed matter-of-factly by the customer service rep at the gate \"You missed your flight.\" Apparently, this was our fault. Not American Airlines fault. He informed us that as policy they can only hold the flight for 2 extra minutes. We were rebooked on a flight that would not be leaving until 8:45 pm since all the other flights were full. So instead of arriving in Fort Lauderdale at 6:50 pm we will not be arriving until almost 11 pm. Our day with American Airlines started at 1:15 pm when we arrived for our flight at RDU. So basically I could have driven from RDU to FLL and made it in almost the same amount of time (it\\'s an 11 hour drive). To add insult to injury, none of the staff even acted genuinely sorry. Needless to say, I will never be flying on American Airlines again.   This is the worst experience ever! Please get another airline if you don\\'t want to be frustrated. This airline is so far the worst flight I have ever been to, customer service is bad, their employees have a bad attitude and are rude most of the time. The seats are a completely nightmare, if you travel for long hours you\\'ll end up with neck and back pain because their chairs are so straight up forward. Really bad experience, never flying with them again!   Very unprofessional staff. Showed up on time for flight but the kiosks were not working with one person at the ticket counter. Waiting roughly 4 minutes in line, a second employee showed up to check me in. She then said it was a minute too late to check in the bag. Then I went to the gate to check in my bag at the gate and they said it was too big when they still were checking in other bags and strollers in much larger luggage than I have. The very unhelpful guy went to see if I arrived before 2 pm she then when he stated a showed up before 2 pm, he claimed they stopped putting bags on the plane at 1:51pm (I arrived at 1:53 pm and was told at 1:57 pm that I was a minute late?). Told me I should have used the kiosk and I told him they were broken and continued to be unprofessional. I cannot wait to never fly American Airlines again   Horrible operation. American Airlines made me check my carry on bag, against my will. I had fragile and expensive items in the luggage. I was assigned the last boarding group, and they made everyone check their carry on bags in my group without consent. When I told them I had fragile and expensive items in the luggage, the lady told me she is happy to book me with the first flight out tomorrow morning. (I was on the last flight out) I had to get back to work the next morning, and it wasn\\'t an option to fly out the next morning. I had to get on the flight. Upon boarding, I saw minimal 15-20 empty spaces in the overhead compartment. They could have easily fit everyone\\'s carry on luggage there! I would never fly American Airlines again.   Miami to Cancun. We’ve been sitting in the plane for an hour now because a stewardess didn’t show up to work and we need to wait for a replacement. Now it’s because there is a line for takeoff. Just wanted to address the inconvenience because we had a activity planned for my girlfriends birthday at 3pm and it’s already 11:45pm. Hope we can make it on time!   Worst flying experience I ever had. Every flight was fully booked so you ended up having to check your carry on because they couldn\\'t fit. As I was boarding the flight they tried to stop me for a random bag search after I had already been through security this was at every stop (Cancun and DFW), I told them no I had expensive items packed in my carry-on and was not comfortable with someone going through it. Also I had already been through the nightmare that was security and TSA. From the very beginning even trying to print our boarding passes was a mess. The kiosk printed the tickets for the couple in front of us who had the same flight and stops as us yet ours would not print. They were severely understaffed and unorganized when it came to checking our bags and getting our tickets. Our line wait was over an hour and a half. The line for people who tickets did print at the kiosk was less than 1/4 of the line we waited in. Only had 5 min to spare to get on our flight. Never flying AA again!   To follow up with my previous statement. Thank you for ruining my trip back. I had to spend an extra 350 in travel and lodging expenses. I was standing at my gate with a boarding pass. Not a screenshot, waiting to board my plane. I had another customer tell me the gate had changed. I had my phone in my hand. I didnt get a text, email or update on the app. I had to run to the other gate by the time I got there they told me my flight had left. I ended up getting stranded in downtown Charlotte. I was almost robbed trying to find a place that wasnt 200 a night. While I was at my hotel, I called in, angry, which would understate my feelings at the time. The first rep put me on hold for 45 minutes and laughed at me when I told her about having to make extra arrangements and almost getting robbed. When I spoke to the first manager,  she told me it was my fault and I should have been watching the screens. Then I called back only to have another manager blame me yet again for missing my flight. Im done with this airline and any horror stories any of you hear about the extremely poor customer service and total lack of empathy, believe it. They will not be getting my business again.   I used my miles to get a return ticket to Thailand. My flight there was nice and the staff helped me as I previously had a TBI and was a bit shaky. I had a wheelchair take me between flights to the next flight and thru immigration and they were very accommodating. However. On my return from Thailand back to the USA, I had the most amazing service I have ever had. The stewardess on the Flight from Narita to DFW on January 26th, 2022 went above and beyond my expectations. They helped me open my food, get to the restroom and brought me a snack to have after I took my medicine! They all stopped by to check on me and introduce themselves. I didn’t feel as if it was a pity party. I felt as if they just wanted to make sure I was warm, comfortable and doing ok. I wish I could remember their names, but unfortunately that’s something that my mind doesn’t hold onto these days, But I will remember their smiling faces. I sure hope I get to see them again on my next trip.   Firstly our flight got cancelled, which I understand happens at the moment. Then we had to wait at the airport for 12 hours for the flight we were allocated. We had booked first class tickets, got bumped down to economy. We were on the top of the list for earlier standby flights, but at least 6 people got added to standby flights ahead of us. Even though it was a simple direct flight, non of our luggage made it. We waited for an hour at the airport to make a report - no staff at all, someone told us, they go home at 6pm, We went to hotel and called to make a report, they said the bags would get delivered to hotel. Four out of 6 arrived about 26 hours later. The bags had been opened and gone through - missing handbag and shoes. Called again to report the missing 2 bags and stolen items, they made a report and said the two bags would be delivered that day. Of course they did not arrive. Called 3 more times - no help at all. Now we are flying home, via 3 countries and still nothing. In my opinion - do not fly American, they have given us no assistance and don\\'t seem to care about our bags. I wish we could give the zero stars   No one wore a mask, even before takeoff when eating or drinking could not have been an excuse. This was a flying covid petri dish. Canned announcements were aired now and then but were ignored. I flew the premium seating just below first class, but even the first class passengers were unmasked.  I had booked my reservation and picked my seats (I upgraded) months in advance. 6 hours before the flight left, I was automatically switched to a different flight ( much earlier than my original) due to now missing my connection. I spent 4 hours on hold with American Airlines for them not to help me and told me I had to get my seat assignment once I was at the gate. I was assigned a seat on the flight however it is a middle seat in economy. I am highly disappointed with American Airlines - this is my first and probably last time flying with them.  American Airlines has the absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered. They have no empathy for their clients or customers especially right now. They make mistakes or give out misinformation and do nothing to right those errors. Don’t do it. You will be in much better hands with delta or United. They both will ensure to take care of you where all American cares about is your payment processing through.   Was notified two days prior to travel that my flight was changed from a 6ish hour flight to three flights, including a red eye - which changed my travel time to over 24 hours! No explanation, no compensation, no alternatives offered. Ridiculous! Missed the celebration I was flying to Mexico to attend and wasted two day of my vacation flying and catching up on sleep.   Lynchburg to Tallahassee via Charlotte. I have flown American many times, I have never had a good experience flying with them. However AA is the only airline that has flights in and out of Lynchburg Virginia. The last time I flew with them they broke my checked bag and refused to believe they broke it, they caused me to miss a flight because we sat on the Tarmac for 30 minutes after that flight already being delayed. They proceeded to tell me I should have booked a flight with a longer lay over in CLT. This is one of many times they have delayed a flight before I ever even made it to the airport. If you have he option do not fly with American, the in flight service is good but they simply could not care less if you have make a connection or not.  Absolute garbage. They are worse than Spirit which says a lot. I heard time and time again that AA is awful. I just thought people were being dramatic until it happened to me.   Worst service I’ve ever experienced! My husband and I didn’t get to sit together both ways due to your garbage check in schemes. Absolutely ridiculous!! Instead I have was able to sit with a man slobbering while falling over on my chest during flight. Disgusting. I’m so sick of AA! Never again! We couldn’t check in online and when we arrived at gate the attendant had boarding passes with seats 3 rows apart. AA, you’ve officially lost our business.   I was suppose to fly last night (July 1st 2021) from New York JFK to Cali Colombia, but American Airlines canceled our flight “because of the weather” and rebooked it for Saturday, July 3, 2021. There was a lady, on the customer service line, crying and asked me for help, she asked me for help to translate. I decided to help her, and went with the lady to talk with the ticket agent/ customer service of American Airlines. I explained to the American Airlines employee/ticket agent, the situation of the woman, I was helping. The first thing she told me was, \"I don\\'t care if she has a family that is dying\"!\\xa0 I begged her, to make an exception and book her on another flight for the lady from another city or another airport in order to her to fly earlier, because she couldn’t fly Saturday, it would be too late. After pleading to the ticket agent, she was so rude to me and was yelling at me.\\xa0 She told me again, that there wasn’t other options and that they already rebooked her flight for Saturday.  That was plain and simple disrespectful. Then ticket agent told me she was going to call the police.\\xa0 I decided to stop trying to help the lady, because the ticket agent was being verbally aggressive. I wrote this because I believe this attitude is unacceptable for someone that works in an airline and is supposed to assist customers..\\xa0 This display of disrespectful behavior by this employee gives your company a negative image.   My 90 year old mother-in-law had reservations for a flight out of San Diego to Oklahoma City yesterday. Got to check-in yesterday and was told her flight was cancelled. No empathy from the staff and nothing for the inconvenience, but oh well, nothing you can do (and I was a little happy that we got her for an additional day). Then take her today and everything was “good”. Except that her flight to Phoenix was an hour late. She then missed her connection in Phoenix and had to sit there. She was told she was on Standby (can you imagine this?). She is 90. I then called to see what we can do and the message said “our wait time is 4 hours”. After their automated system couldn’t hear me say “customer service” several times I had to listen repeatedly to a message that said “your call is important to us”.   Just wanted to thank you for the wonderful service I received. My flight from Charlotte to Phoenix (flight 727 on 9/18 at 1120am) was a wonderful experience. I normally have a bunch of anxiety when I fly but the trip was extremely smooth. The flight attendants were absolutely amazing, especially Skyler (didn’t catch his last name) and Tine Erickson. They were both extremely helpful and ensured I had a great flight. Would definitely travel with the airline again based on their service and personalities. Please pass on my accolades to both of them.   Tampa to Manchester. Original flight was delayed so could not get connecting flight up the whole East coast to get home, was forced to reschedule for the following day, was not comped in any way, had to sleep in the airport because all hotels around the area where several hundred dollars. Do not fly American Airlines, they will charge you a fortune to change, they strand you they just don\\'t care about you.  Absolutely awful. I will never ever fly American again. Canceled our flight at the boarding time. Instead of letting us rebook on a United flight insisted we had to take American and travel 2 days to get back with kids and no luggage since it was checked. Staff was so rude and absolutely unhelpful or caring. Worst most miserable experience ever.  Terrible. Changed the time of flights, increasing layover period, and made us switch planes upon boarding. Overall the trip took much longer than anticipated.  We booked a flight to Sint Maarten and two days before we were set to leave AA sends out an email to change our flight at no additional cost. When I went to look at available flights there were none, I found this odd! I called the airline and asked what the email meant. The associate assured me that this was just an option and the flight will not be delayed. The day of our flight we get an email stating our flight is delayed 6 hours. We waited for the next flight and even boarded the aircraft before finding out they didn’t have a crew to fly the plane. Long story short we were deplaned and left to wait for hours until they could find a pilot for the plane. So unprofessional. I never had this problem with Southwest! I will not be flying with this airline again. The most the customer service rep could do is understand we were frustrated and asked if we wanted to cancel our reservations and go back home.   As of right now, I am sitting on this plane. We have a connecting flight in Charlotte to Miami, we have been sitting here on this flight for 30-45 minutes with little to no movement. After rushing us onto the flight and telling us we were going to be leaving shortly, we are still here. We are not being told what is going on or how much longer this will be taking place or how long this delay is becoming. It’s terrible. The pilot even acknowledged that we had a connecting flight they didn’t want us to miss. Too little, too late. Will not fly American again.   Today July 19, 2021 I was supposed to fly to Dallas Texas from Killeen Texas, and from Dallas Texas to Chicago Illinois at 12.47pm, I was there early around 10.15am at the gate waiting till 12.30 and they cancelled my flight, without notifying me ahead of time, then I received a text message notifying me that I was booked for another flight at 1.20, same terminal then every about 25-30 minutes they kept changing my flight. I got in line to speak with the counter assistant to see whats going on, she booked me another flight at 6.30 and said I had to be there by 5.30 if I wanted to leave and come back, she didn\\'t know how to explain what was going on and why my flight kept delaying and changing. I got a job to go to and a home to go to, when I left the airport I received another text saying my flight was changed at 6.37 then 30 minutes after I received another saying it was changed till 7.30 and it kept on till the last flight. I called American Airlines and they had me on hold for about an hour, then I called again and they said waiting time for them to call me back was between 2 hours to 3.50hrs and when they called me they kept hanging up on me, so they texted me and they gave me the last flight for today which was 8.30. When I was ready to head to the airport at the time I was supposed to they ended up canceling my flight, I went in person to see what was going on, there was nobody at the counter, a guy with no uniform, only a green vest on came over the counter and took care of me which didn\\'t help either. He said he was new, he had to call American Airlines for them to see what was going on because he didn\\'t know, they say I was booked from Dallas to Kansas and Kansas to Chicago, when I\\'m in Killeen how am I supposed to get to Dallas? I asked to cancel the flight because I found a cheaper flight through another airline in Austin airport, they didn\\'t want to give me my refund either, I asked where my luggage was and if I could get it back since all my stuff was there, they didn\\'t know where it was either. Not only today, last Friday July 16 when I arrived from Chicago to Dallas I waited about an hour at the gate and when we all got in the airplane they made us wait an hour and a half because the airplane didn\\'t have gas and they had to fill it up, plus the water from the bathroom was supposed to be changed also. This is the worst experience I have had, first and last time flying with American Airlines. Its just horrible - never again, another night at a hotel, money wasted in taxi, food etc..   Cedar Rapids to Miami. Left Cedar Rapids on the 6:50 am flight, spent 45 minutes at the check in counter with a lady that was incompetent. Barely made to the gate in time to get on the plane. Got to Charlotte and boarding passes were all screwed up. spent an hour at customer service desk trying to get tickets fixed to get on the next plane. Barely made that flight and got to Miami and they told me they forgot to take my bag off the plane. Told me they would get hot right away and deliver it to the hotel. When I got to the Hotel and told the counter gal that they would be bringing my bag she laughed and said AA is the worst, they see this at the hotel all the time and that they probably would never deliver my bag. Checked and AA said that it was picked up by a driver at 3:27 and I would have it by 7:27. Checked at 7:30 and it said that it was picked up at 7:27 and I would see it by 9:00 pm. Called the 800 # and they had a terrible attitude and said I should see it within 12 hours. Said the driver probably had a medical Emergency. Stay away. No regard for customer service. These people don\\'t care.   I was flying from BWI to O’Hare then to London on October 29, 2021. The flight from BWI was 3 hrs delayed so I missed my connecting flight to London in O’Hare. The staff at BWI assured me that AA will take care of my hotel accommodation but they did not and I ended up sleeping at the airport and I also missed very important transactions in London! I called them but they put me in a 2 hour waiting period multiple times. I would never fly through American Airlines again.  Fayetteville to Santo Domingo via Miami. My husband had to go to the Dominican Republic for a funeral. The ticket was expensive $1302 bc it was so soon. He left XNA to MIA to SDQ on 5-23-2022. That trip went well. But on the return flight yesterday (5-28-2022) he was supposed to leave at 3:23 pm, but the flight was delayed several times and did not leave until 5:33 pm. No open gate so they were forced to stay inside the airplane for over an hour. Then when they were able to get out of the plane there were so many people in the immigration that they all lost their connecting flight. Instead of trying to put them up in a hotel or something like that everybody was forced to sleep at the airport. My husband said that there were pregnant ladies and ladies with kids and older people. The only thing they did was give everybody coupons to go to Subway which was closed so nobody was able to even get food. They finally put my husband on a flight to Charlotte this morning around 8:00 and he finally arrived home at around 1:00. The service from this airline to everybody has never been very good in my opinion. This is the second time that something like this has happened to my husband and it also happened to my stepson. And on top of that my husband said that some of the staff were very rude and not very helpful. Delta definitely has better customer service and is more willing to help in situations such as this to accommodate people and make them comfortable.  This airline is awful in almost every way. I normally fly Delta and god I wished I stuck to that. 3/4 of my flights got delayed with the last delay being so long all the people around me missed their flight, luckily my layover was long enough to just barely make it to my gate on time. They had us waiting for our luggage at a baggage return but what they didn’t tell any of us was they had actually put it somewhere else despite the screen saying it would be right there. The girl at the gate wouldn’t let me check in my bag and told me I would have to do it at the gate. I told her I had stuff they wouldn’t allow past security (soaps and stuff above 4oz) and she didn’t care. Ended up losing a lot of shower items and I spent a long time crying. Security guy showed me more compassion that anyone working for American Airlines. They were all so incredibly rude. Last but not least one of my flights had used masks under the chair and gum on the inside of my seatbelt with crumbs all over the seat. Will never fly again can’t pay me enough money for this nightmare of an airline.   Being unable to fly during a medical crisis. Our governor is asking for no travel so I won\\'t risk it. My ticket is extended to Dec 2021 and if I won\\'t fly by then I\\'m out my money. American Airlines would have me risk my life over $400. I care for my 80 year old mother and they said its your risk. Poor customer service and lack of empathy. Makes me wonder what other safety measures are not important enough. Oh they did say if my flight was delayed or canceled or if I died I would get my refund. What a way to treat your customers.   Dallas Ft Worth to Honolulu return.. Overall, very pleased with American on these flights. This applies even to the return, which occurred during the week that AA was in meltdown because of the terrible weather in Dallas. Ground and cabin staff were courteous and efficient. Flights were on time. The seats on both the 777-200 and 300 are great, better in my opinion than the lie-flat seats that competitors offer from the midwest to Hawaii. Extensive IFE, worked well. Noise-cancelling headphones are excellent. One annoyance is that crew collect them 30 minutes before landing, but they did offer some standard earphones for the remainder of the flight. Food was OK, served on one tray as expected since the Covid19 guidelines were put in place. Life hasn\\'t been easy for airline staff with the extra handling r/t masks, etc, and I think they did a great job. Special thanks to the baggage handlers who got my delayed bags to my final destination within 24 hours, 1000 miles from Dallas, and 100 miles from the nearest American-served airport.   Worst experience ever with an airline. We started off pretty good we travel with a service dog so they were very nice about it. From our departure we were delayed so knowing this the airline knew we weren’t going to make it for the connection flight either way they let us depart. Once in Miami it took us awhile to get off the plane. Most of us were rushing because we had to take another plane. It didn’t matter because there was a never ending line to go through passport control same with the check point so we were missing the connection flights regardless. I don’t understand why American Airlines makes you get your luggage at your arrival in Miami and then makes you drop up right before the check point I never had to do such thing with other airlines this was such a waste of time knowing the time frame we had for the connection was very short so thanks AA for making things more complicated. So after missing our flight we ended up rebooking. They didn’t have anything to offer because they had tons of people waiting to be reseat from different flights so seems like the airline have a problem with schedules because it was more than one flight with the same issue. We ended up on a standby list hoping to get out of the airport the next day by 7 am. They didn’t offer a hotel room or food because according to them this wasn’t the airline’s fault it was an “air traffic issue” they also said it was because the bad weather up north which wasn’t true. After all the next day at 7 am we showed up at the counter hoping to find a seat in this airplane we found out we were 45 people waiting to be reseated. We didn’t get a seat in that flight so we had to talk to an agent and put us first on the next waiting list. We finally got to the 8 am JFK flight and they finally let us depart after such a long day of traveling. Honestly I was expecting better service from this airline but unfortunately it wasn’t a good experience, hopefully I won’t use them again. Very disappointed   The flight itself was great, the flight attendants were very nice and accommodating, met our expectations for the first time in first class, but taking the connecting flight back from Mexico to Phoenix, to go through customs, collect our luggage, go through security checkpoint again, we almost did not make our connecting flight. We should\\'ve had more time for this process, we had to run through the airport to our gate after we got through what we needed to do. We overheard the employees on the PSA acting very immature to announce that the doors are about to close if we don\\'t make it. My husband is a disabled military vet, and has physical disabilities, almost didn\\'t make it from running so long and so far to get to our gate, and when he finally made it, he got laughed at. We are both very upset at the limited time and the way we were treated through the airport process, we will never do another connecting flight if we can avoid it, that was utterly ridiculous! On our initial flight from Dallas to Cabo, our luggage was delayed because it was put on another flight   My flight experience per the route noted and on my return from Phoenix through Charlotte to Harrisburg were uneventful and pleasant. Using the American Airlines app with the early check-in was easy. Mobile boarding passes are the GOAT. The app also helped me find my way from gate to gate in the Charlotte airport with approximate walking time. In fear of hiccups, I made sure my carry-on had everything I needed in the event my luggage didn\\'t make the trip. I put an air tag in my luggage just for my own peace of mind. But the app also enabled me to know that my luggage was on board, so when I went to the baggage claim, I knew it was coming out eventually. No stress. For my trip out, I planned a long layover in Charlotte but on the way back, I changed my original flight and the choices were limited. My layover was less than an hour in Charlotte and I was a little worried about making my connecting. I was flying back two days after the Super Bowl, so there\\'s that too. Honestly, all my flights were early upon arrival and I had no issues whatsoever with luggage. The in-flight crew was very friendly and helpful. Seriously, no bad vibes from anyone at all. You know how it can be -- people are professional and helpful, but somewhat unfriendly. That certainly was not the case at American Airlines in my experience. Obviously, I can\\'t speak to what the service would\\'ve been like had issues arisen. In the event my flight didn\\'t make my connecting on time on the way home, I was prepared to re-book and find a place close to stay for the night. Like I said above, I fully expected there might be hiccups and tried to anticipate them to the best of my ability - and stay calm Getting upset, while sometimes unavoidable, only makes things worse. I will also add that I witnessed no negative encounters during any of my four flights or while at the airports. In a day and age where you\\'re sort of at the mercy of what you hear/read internet or other news, and when that news tends to spotlight everything that\\'s wrong with our world, I would not have been surprised to witness or hear people being rude to each other, to staff, or just in general. Traveling is tiring. Airplane seating is tight. People get frustrated. I am happy to report that my trips were filled with kindness and courtesy. The only negative (and maybe I was technologically challenged) was that I would\\'ve had to pay extra to use the wifi. The in-flight entertainment was easily accessible, with a lot of choices - so that was good. I will definitely fly American again. I felt welcomed, accommodated, and safe.  Flight was delayed 3 hours due to a delay of the previous flight from New York. We could not board our 10.30pm flight until 1.30am and no efforts were made from American Airlines to accommodate is in any way or explain the situation. This is an ongoing issue with this airline and I chose to fly with other airlines whenever possible. We were exhausted and the only options we were given was to fly all the way back to Chicago and then to Boston and arrive 24 hours later. We had a ride picking us up from Boston that had to stay awake all night because of the delay and the inability to fly out the following day.   I flew fon Panama to Miami in Copa airlines. I got to Miami at 11pm august 12, my fly was August 13 at 8.29. I was supposed to be waiting 9 hours, I call AA customer service to see if I can get on the 6am, she said the system won’t let her do it but if approach the desk they will gladly help me. Well I was helped by Henry, he was very professional and polite. He change my flight by 6am in less that 5 minutes. The crew in the terminal and on the plane were very nice and professional. My experience with AA was A++.   American Airlines used to be a good airline. My husband and I have the AAadvantage credit card and have use it for miles in the past. Now it’s one of the worst flight companies out there. We travel 3-4 times a year if not more. We have had so many flights cancel over and over. They are no help. Flight was canceled at 11:30pm they said we need to call American Airlines and rebook a flight. I was on the phone for 3 hours. They rebooked us to another airport. Told us to Uber to another airport in NY then left us in the wrong airport in another country. Said you can take a train or fly to your last destination because we can’t get you there. All the extra cost for us to Uber from LaGuardia to JFK then we had to book a flight from Stockholm to Copenhagen (our cost). American Airlines should reimburse us for those extra expenses because our original fight took us to Copenhagen and then they canceled it and didn’t rebook us to the same destination. August 17-2022 Flight coming back to the USA. Stockholm to London was on time. London to Dallas on time. Dallas - OKC canceled again. We had to book another flight from Dallas to OKC for the next day. We booked it and they canceled it again. Two days later for flights now. Most horrible flight experience we’ve ever had.  I have a waiver from a flight that was affected by Hurricane Dorian. The flight waiver expires in August of this year and I wasn’t able to use it because of Covid. American refuses to extend my waiver even though travel is unsafe during this global pandemic. They do not care about their customers. The rep I spoke to said I needed to use the waiver by August or I would lose it. And then she hung up on me.  It’s literally not worth the savings in the flight. They are such a pain to work with, don’t care at all about their customers concerns, and they have zero empathy or care. If I could give them a 0/10 I would. Fly with literally any airlines instead. Even a budget airlines like Frontier has been infinitely more helpful.  My husband and I were on flight AA1400 out of Miami today. We were attempting to get to our honeymoon destination in Jamaica. We boarded the flight around 12:10 PM with an expected take off at 12:56 PM. There was light rain that turned into thunderstorms for the first hour of us waiting to take off, delaying our flight. After the first hour it went back to light rain and we noticed several airplanes starting to take off on the runway. After waiting for another hour with minimal updates from the pilot, we were instructed to exit the aircraft. We did as we were told and went to the gate to wait for further instructions. We were informed after about 45 mins minutes that another pilot will be taking over and we were able to re-board the aircraft. The time at re-boarding was approximately 4:30. After another hour of waiting on the now second pilot to take us to our destination, the plane suddenly turned around on the ramp when we were very close to take-off. The plane was taken back to the terminal and all of us passengers were waiting to hear what the delay was this time. Unfortunately for us, there was little communication as to why we could not depart for our destination now 5 hours after our SCHEDULED departure time. I would like to say there was a “vague” explanation but I simply cannot. Even their pilot could not explain why he was not allowed to take us where we paid good money to be. It was at this time we were instructed to de-board the plane a SECOND time. After some talk amongst the flight crew and I suppose them communicating with their outside resources, they informed us of a THIRD pilot who would be boarding and be responsible for taking us to our destination. We FINALLY were able to depart at exactly 7:06PM. We had been on that plane for 7 hours today, just sitting and waiting and left in the dark. The flight crew kindly passed around cookies and one cup of water during our first delay around approximately 2:30. When asked to de-board there was no time for any passengers to stop and eat because we were trying to stay close to be informed on the situation only to re-board and wait an additional 3 hours. There were several small children on this flight as well. AA should be extremely disappointed in how this situation was handled. It was unprofessional and cruel to leave us waiting and waste our time. My husband and I missed our first day at our expensive resort on our first day of our honeymoon. They left children and other passengers crying and hungry. Shame on them. I am not one to leave a bad review or even write an email to this extent (especially on my honeymoon) but given the situation it is much deserved. We tried on our honeymoon to call and get compensation and all we received were two $50 trip vouchers. We will NEVER fly AA again and neither should you. They lack care for their customers and accountability. They make it hard to file a complaint because I am sure they get too many. Do yourself a favor and fly Delta.   My flight was rescheduled to 12:00pm when originally I had it scheduled at 8:30am I got to the airport at 4am and the airline sent an email at 4:23am to notify the delay. I had to wait 8 hours and there’s was other flight that left at 10:30am. No weather issues just business decisions, if the airline can at least notify 12 hours in advance, but they clearly don’t care about people’s plans just their money. I also had a delayed leaving Chicago. Terrible at scheduling and moving things around. Definitely never getting tickets for this airline again.   I don’t even know where to begin with this huge travel fiasco I had to endure with a baby in tow.  American canceled our flights due to weather on 2/25/22. Okay, fine. We tried rebooking on the app several times, the flights kept disappearing and we get error messages. Call times were over 5 hrs. Finally get a call back from an agent the next day. The earliest she could rebook us for was 3/1 (four days after our original departure). In the meantime we’ve tried rebooking other airlines, and same error message kept happening. Not to mention flights were four times the cost with 11hr or more flight times as opposed to the 5 hr flight time we originally booked. We keep calling every day between Friday and Tuesday to see if anything else had opened up - nothing. Now we’re stuck in Miami for four additional days - racking up costs on hotel, meals, car rental, gas, diapers, etc.  We check in for our flights on the app Monday night and seats are confirmed. When we arrive at the airport two hrs early on Tuesday, the agent says we don’t have tickets. When she reviews our history, she notices the agent that rebooked us forgot to reissue our tickets. The agent puts us on standby.  When we get to the counter at the gate and explain our situation to the agent there, she says we have to wait, so we do. We later realize that the agent starts giving away seats to customers flying solo as they become available instead of following protocol (wait until all paying customers are checked in and then go down the standby list in order - we were the top 3 on the list). We ask her why and she says because they are in a rush and need to board the plane. That they cannot afford to wait for 3 seats to open up, they must give them away asap. Although 3 seats eventually became available, because the agent failed to follow protocol, we didn’t make the flight.  We return to the original check in agent and explain what happened. She was confused and confirmed that the staff person did not follow proper standby protocol. She rebooks us for the following day on Wednesday morning but cannot sit us together. I ask her about hotel and meal vouchers and she said she cannot do anything and for us to file a complaint. Yet another night at a hotel, missing work, school, and meal expenses. We arrive at the airport two hours early on the day of our flight so that we can speak to the agent at the counter about sitting us next to our two year old son. The agent says they cannot do anything for us and to “figure it out” when we board the plane with other passengers. We were so distraught by their refusal to help us that two passengers then volunteered to move so that we can be seated with our 2 year old. It was only at that point that Victor (the agent at the counter who refused to help us) then proceeded to change our seats. AA doesn’t care about families. AA doesn’t care about customers. All they care about is their bottom line $$$. I am disgusted by the lack of professionalism and empathy, gross negligence, refusal to follow proper protocols, refusal to provide customers with hotel and meal vouchers when they were the ones who messed up. The financial and emotional damages they caused us were too much to bear. I will never fly American Airlines again and I hope you don’t either.  Twice, delayed flights, plans ruined because can\\'t make connecting fought to destination. They don\\'t give a damn. Done with them. Recommend you choose another carrier.   Booked a round trip flight from PIT to TUS through DFW. The flight out was slightly delayed, which cause us to miss our connection. While several other flights were scheduled, we couldn’t get on a flight until the next day and had to get a hotel. On the return flight, same thing happened. We missed our connecting flight by 5 min. The airplane was still there but the gate agent had already closed the door and wouldn’t let any of us on. In both instances, customer service was awful. They treated us as if it was our fault for being late. Also, in both instances, they couldn’t accurately track our luggage.   It\\'s been a decade or so since I\\'ve flown AA. The trip out, which I am not reviewing here, added 3 hours to our travel time which was a guessing game of, \"will we or won\\'t we\". The trip back was the doozy. We had a flight scheduled for 3 months. All locked up with seats selected and all. On the day of our travel home from Eagle, CO airport, we received a notice via the AA app that the flight was delayed and that we MUST choose another connecting flight because we\\'d miss our Chicago O Hare connection. So we do and the flight that was chosen via the app actually took us to DC instead of MD. We called to correct this item and that transfer only took 26 minutes on the phone. At this time, we were on the hour long bus ride to the airport to catch our now confirmed 240pm flight. As SOON as we got that confirmation, we checked the app immediately and there was another delay 2:40 to 4:02pm We figured, \"okay, things happen but let\\'s make the most of it\". We waited at the Eagle airport for 5 hours before the notifications started flying. Delayed again to 5pm. Again, looking like we\\'d miss our connecting flight again but then reassured by the staff at the check in desk that we\\'d be fine. I brought up that there seemed to be confusion with the app and the information that they had. Again, reassured that we\\'d be fine. The time finally rolled around to board and this same attendant came running up to us to apologize about the information she shared a half hour ago. We would in fact, likely not make our connecting flight. So, we took this flight anyway. Got to the airport and the plane taxied for a half hour to get to our terminal (this included wait time for a spot to open?). We asked the check in attendant if we could get to the next gate before they left, he said we could. He didn\\'t offer to radio ahead to hold the door for 5 minutes or anything. We ran. And I mean, almost had a heart attack ran to go the 20 gates to make the flight. They were pulling away as we showed up. The first time I\\'ve ever seen a plane pull away from the concourse on time ironically. The desk attendant of course couldn\\'t help us because all flights out of Texas apparently stop at 730pm? I expressed my displeasure with the fact that everyone would tell us there were delays, rarely did anyone know what system was disclosing the delays to customers and that no one could tell us why there were so many delays. We were told ,\"weather\". Not where the weather was bad but that there was \"weather\". Eagle was 28 degrees with blue skies and jets were taking off left and right. Texas was 65 degrees and Maryland was in the teens with no snow or ice. We were offered the very last flight out of Dallas but it would get us in to DC at 2am. We reluctantly accepted with confirmation of a ride from one of our good friends. Otherwise, we were stuck in a motel and another connecting flight through Charlotte to BWI. The airlines are crumbling but this was just horrendous. We were not the only ones affected this day by AA. Nor will we be the last.   This was the worst traveling experience I have ever had. While on our way to the airport we were informed our flight was pushed back. Once we arrived they told us they had canceled it all together and that they will get us on the next available flight. We had to return our rental car and had already lost our hotel. Well since they canceled multiple (which we found out today was because of rain) we had to go to 10 different hotels to find a room. The people at the American desk basically told us they can\\'t help us and we are shit out of luck. We tried to call American and was on hold for 2 hours before we gave up. No one would help us or help us figure anything out about a refund. We had to call into work and rebook a car to stay another night. Mind you it was close to almost $400 all said and done between hotel and car. The airlines said they would not help us with any of those costs. We arrive today to fly out and no one would help us again. Everyone was short and acted liked they did not care at all to even speak with us. We understand they personally can\\'t help it but to not even try to help us? The first flight to Charlotte they decided to not allow us drinks or even wifi. The trip from there to Des moines was some what better. We had also paid for upgraded seats, once they canceled the original flight, we tried to figure out our refund. No one would help us. We had to pay another almost $150 to get our original seats we paid for. Then they issued some sort of credit with American for later to use. I want my money back. I tried to give each new person we dealt with a chance to help and almost everyone was short, rude and didn\\'t not help us at all. I will most definitely not be flying with American again. I don\\'t want a credit for a later flight. I want my money back. We pay a lot of money to fly and to be so sorry about your luck and not try to resolve anything at all for us was really horrible business practice.  Distance between gates is long without mass transit or enough moving sidewalks. Year-round, you have to exit the building, in all weather scenarios, and board a shuttle bus to terminals. This might not be so bad if the shuttle stopped at each terminal, but it does not, so wherever you need to go, there us still walking involved, sometimes back to the terminal you need but just drove past. When landing, American Airlines said they were holding connecting flights, but mine was gone (and left early, at that) when I reached the gate after having to wait for and then hop the shuttle bus. Then, when I wanted to go back, from terminal F to terminal B to get a hotel room, I was told the shuttle was closed for the night...it was not yet 9 pm. When I asked an AA manager for a ride on a cart from terminal F to terminal B, he denied my request. This is unacceptable for any airport to treat passengers in this manner, but really not a good look for the city of brotherly love! I was told that I would get a discount on the hotel, but Marriott (attached to the hotel at terminal B) did not honor it. I was told by airport personnel that there was a shuttle to the hotel, but when I called to make a reservation, I was told no shuttle. There is a shuttle, until 11 pm, but based on that info and information from another airport information clerk who said no hotel shuttle as well, I had to walk from terminal F to terminal B, not a short distance for a senior citizen and one who had already walked and shuttled several directions and terminals. For the most part, no one who worked in the airport or for AA seemed to care one iota! Also, I had paid for Priority boarding, but did not get this, flight was re-booked. Then, when arrived in Manchester, NH, no one in baggage office to get my bag from night before, and AA desk personnel told me to walk back and stand by the door, he\\'d be back soon. No one at AA in Manchester, NH seemed to care, either. Terrible experience overall!  July 24 I traveled from Philadelphia to Doha Qatar and hate American Airlines. They were 5 hours late plus didn\\'t give us a glass of water and we all were badly hungry. My daughter has to submit her assignment, I was ready to pay for wifi but system was off and my daughter was crying because she couldn\\'t submit her assignment to get grades to university. My younger daughter was crying for food. Everyone was hungry but after 5 hours when flight take off they came to give us Tissue papers, then came to collect tissue papers then came to distribute wine and drinks. We were dying for food and requesting for at least cookies. They didn\\'t compensate at all.   Left Colombia May 29 2022, from Pereira my second flight was scheduled at Miami International airport at 9pm to Pittsburgh PA (Home). The flight was canceled, I was sent to customer services at the airport, gate 37, wait in line for 4 hours, got to a person from American Airlines who was really rude, I asked for a supervisor who was even ruder. Another staff member that felt bad told me to go to the second floor to another American Airlines area where I had to wait for 2 hours until I was finally helped. I got another flight for the next day, May 30th from a different airport. Went to baggage claim, told my bags were sent to Pittsburgh and not to worry. I took a taxi from Miami Intl Airport to Fort Lauderdale airport. I paid $80 dollars for the taxi, money that will never be reimbursed to me. I was sent from there to New York and from NY to Pittsburgh, I got home at 6pm, went to American baggage claims, they said the bags were never sent to Pittsburgh they were showing in NY. I called American Airlines around 11pm, they say please go to the airport your bags are there, went to the airport, my bags were not there and they said at that point that the bags were showing in Miami again. I got the bags delivered to my house this morning. I\\'m really angry and frustrated.   When it comes to being unreliable, no one does it better than American Airlines.  My flight kept getting delayed by several hours and then we boarded. However, I’m not sure why we boarded because there were no available pilots for another hour. This Airline had customers buying tickets but didn’t allocate the proper number of pilots to meet demand. I get home several hours late because of the business model of this company. This should not be allowed. This should not be legal. Seriously AA, get your act together if you’re going to sell us these overpriced tickets. I will never again fly American Airlines.   With a very heavy heart I decided to write this letter to share a long list of mistakes made by American Airlines in our last travel experience. We had no idea how much trouble we would be by trusting a company that seemed just about right at first glance. We are a group of 6 people (3 couples), average ages between 60-70, semi-retired (still working since social security income doesn´t even cover the average expenses) and self-employed. We had been planning this trip for several months since all of us had to close our schedules, save money and make it work according to our budgets. With all the inflation, recession it was already a struggle to make it work for us all. Everything started with our flight from Nashville to Miami being cancelled only 10 hours prior. We depended 100% on that flight to take an International flight to Samana (Dominican Republic) after only 4h layover. American Airlines is the only airline with that destination available and has only 1 flight/week to that location, so losing that flight would literally ruin the whole vacation. Our Resort was already reserved/paid for and could not be cancelled, so a no-show would cost us cancellation fee money as well. Immediately when we were notified that our flight was cancelled we called American Airlines Customer Service, it took nothing less than 1.5h to finally reach a representative and to be honest, she was not helpful at all. One more hour waiting and we finally could talk to a supervisor. She could not rebook us with American Airlines or any other partner so we decided to start searching flights from Atlanta (checking all other airlines) to Miami and ask the supervisor to change our coming back flight (final destination in Atlanta instead of Nashville so we could leave our car there and have a car to drive back home). Two hours later we could get our coming back flights changed with final destination in Atlanta but at that point there were no more flights available from Atlanta to Miami. Back to square one we decided to get us a flight straight to Punta Cana and forget the AA flight to Samana since would be impossible to get there in time even if we decided to drive. I found a flight from Atlanta to Punta Cana (5.5h drive from our Resort) and all of us could get a seat (we purchased from different websites all at once so nobody would be left behind). This flight cost each couple the average amount of $938. We loaded our Van and drove to Atlanta right away ($165.00 paid in gas). I also had to get a parking space for 7 days which cost us total $87.55. We finally flew to Punta Cana and got a 5.5h transfer to Samana, which also cost us the amount of $412.05. After this huge adventure we could make it there 24h later and it was the most stressful and frustrating hours in our lives. But the mistakes kept happening. When we got to El Catey Samana Airport, one of the check-in employees (still being trained) made a mistake: he forgot to print the tickets for the flight from Miami to Atlanta for 2 of us (Mr. Dannie Glover and Mrs. Hope Glover), later on in Miami the lady at the gate was extremely rude and unprofessional (her name is Valentina by the way). Flight to Atlanta was delayed 2 hours and she sent us to Gate D37 (Customer Service) just 5 min before boarding.   Our flight to Miami was nicely on time. Our flight to Dallas had a delay of about 45 minutes, which resulted in us missing our flight to Killeen. American Airlines did immediately arrange a hotel, taxi transportation and meal vouchers for us. The staff at their help desk in Dallas were super friendly and very helpful. They booked us for a flight the next morning. All this was free of charge! Thank you American Airlines staff. We will surely recommend this Airline to others. Keep up the good customer service.   I was supposed to take off from LAX to TPA on October 21, 2021 at 9.30pm. However, 20 minutes before boarding we were told that the flight was delayed until 6am (which turned out to be a lie), because there were no pilots. We were told to call a number or wait in the lane for the customer service. I was unable to reach the customer service via phone (I had been on hold for lengthy amount of time) as such I kept on waiting in the line to the customer service at the airport. After 2 hours of waiting, I received a text message that the 6am flight I was supposed to take was cancelled until 9.30pm the next day, and I could either accept it or chose one with ridiculous connections (i.e. fly from LAX to Seattle and from Seattle to Tampa or fly from LAX to JFK and from JFK to Tampa). I ended up waiting in the line for 4 hours to interact with very unprofessional and impolite customer service representatives. We were all told that their system is \"down\" as such, we must book hotels on our own and \"try\" applying for a refund when the \"time comes\". We were also offered to fly standby with horrible connections, since there are no tickets available, however, I could go to the website and see that tickets were still available, which proves that American Airlines was trying to sell the remaining tickets while keeping us on a standby. One of the ladies waiting with me had an autistic son (she told me he was), she was denied help with hotel and told that her only option is 9.30pm flight the next day. If she could not book a hotel, she had to worry about her son wondering around the airport. Other ladies waiting in the line had kids with them as well. They were also told to figure out hotels on their own or sleep at the airport. Further, one of the customer service representatives in her conversation with a customer said, “American Airlines have never gotten back to pre-COVID conditions, we do not have enough people, we have less flights”. There is not a single company that went back to pre-COVID conditions. If you do not have enough pilots, why do you schedule flight you cannot make?! While listening to all of those unprofessional and impolite responses from American Airlines staff, I booked my own hotel, found myself a flight with Delta, and had to request a refund on my own (currently under American Airlines review). I was forced to stay in LA due to the actions of this unprofessional company. I (and other customers) was disrespected by American Airlines customer service and received no help, no food vouchers, and no help booking hotels. This is unacceptable behavior. There is no way, American Airlines did not know that there are no pilots until 20 minutes before boarding. Words cannot express how dissatisfied I am. I will do all that I can to make sure I do not fly American Airlines again.  We had a flight take off from Tampa to Dallas to connect to Hawaii. Our plane was later on arrival, as we got off we talked to several members of American Airlines stating that our connecting flight to Hawaii is leaving can you please notify them that we are coming. As stated not our fault we landed late, they confirmed and we went ahead. As we got to the gate we were rudely told the gates had closed and to go to customer service. When we arrived at customer service we were already booked on a flight that was taken off in 10 minutes. Moral of the story the company is terrible and yet again I have been screwed. Never will I fly with them again, knowing they don’t care because their customer service is terrible as well.  This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. I bought the same exact tickets as my friends so we could all fly together, only mine was changed and I never received any notice about it. I had to sit and wait in the airport for 12 hours for the new flight which would now have me home 24 hours after I was supposed to be. My other friend, who flew Delta, got a straight shot from Vegas to New Hampshire for a cheaper price, while I have 2 layovers. All of this is a huge inconvenience and very annoying to go through but now I’m sitting waiting for my last flight home and they keep delaying it because they can’t find crew members? How can you not find your crew members? What kind of unprofessional place is this? I’m disgusted with the way they treat their passengers and give no help. I complained to someone and was told to send complaints by email. Which I did, I received an email back saying they’d get back to me in 7-15 business days! This is horrid and I will never be flying with American Airlines ever again.   If I have a choice, I always avoid American. Flew from Columbus to Miami in January. Zero service in First Class. Not even a snack basket. Horrible. Today I’m flying from Miami to Aspen. Internet wasn’t even working. The entertainment worked, but it cut out 3 times during 90 minute movie. Had to start completely over 3 times after a 10 minute blackout. The worst part about flying American is their access to the Admiral Club for my 2 hour layover. No access for First Class passengers. I mostly fly Alaska and Delta and have no trouble getting into their lounges. Avoid American if possible. When they thank you at the end for choosing American, it’s never because I chose them, I had no other choice.   I have never been so disgusted with an airline, customer service and their lack of information as I have been with this company. Even after not having a pilot they boarded the whole plane and let us sit for an hour, no information, no explanation. When the finally cancelled it and we finally got off the flight customer service basically told us the luggage being on the cancelled flight wasn\\'t their problem. The people at luggage customers service were the rudest, most uneducated on the airlines process that could have been there. After the cancelled flight they tried to get us booked on a flight 2 days later! Completely unacceptable. What were we supposed to do, miss 2 full days of work because of your screw up? Never again will u get my business!    Writing this complaint because we missed our connecting flight from Monterey to Phoenix. Delayed in Monterey for close to an hour. Unknown reason for the delay, which put us in jeopardy for our connecting flight in Phoenix to get home to Pittsburgh. Got in Phoenix and off the plane by 3:25. Our connecting flight was for 3:40. Got to the gate by 3:30 and was told we were not allowed to get on the plane. It was an American flight to an American flight. Was not our fault that the connecting flight was delayed. Totally the airlines fault. We were at the gate 10 minutes before take off. Not to be allowed to board was ridiculous. Had to sit in Phoenix airport for 6 hours, catch a flight to Charlotte and not arrive there until 5:15 the next morning. 21/2 hour layover in Charlotte. Finally will get on board at 7:17 and arrive in Pittsburgh around 9:10. Miss an important doctor’s appointment scheduled for the next day. Needless to say, will never fly American Airlines again.'"
